# Modal

Each slot (*footer*, *actions*, *default*, *close*, *title*) has access to the modal itself. This allows you to call any method or query any prop/data-value by using the slot's scope. A practical use case for this is shown in the example below. The modal's body (*default* slot) contains a link that, when clicked, closes the modal.

::: tip

There are multiple ways to show a modal.

**Using `$fdModal.open(modalName)`**

You can use the `$fdModal.open(modalName)` to open modals from anywhere. Just give each modal a name (using the `name`-prop) and pass this to the `open`-function.

**Manually showing the modal**

Of course you can also manually show or close the modal by simply calling the corresponding methods in it:

- `show(event?)`: shows the modal.
- `close(event?)`: closes the modal.

## Default Modal

<d-example name="default-modal">
</d-example>

## Nested Modals

You can nest modals just by calling `$fdModal.open(â€¦)` multiple times.

<d-example name="nested-modals">
</d-example>
