# Transition to latest Version of Fundammental Styles
This document lists *leftovers*, things that have to be done, in order to finish the transition to the latest Fundamental Styles version (from the perspective of a developer working on Fundamental Vue).

This includes things like missing components or parts of it, removing components or replacing them. This also includes missing tests, documentation and other chore-related tasks. The missing things are described by using potential git commit messages - so instead of writing *"Tests missing"* we write *"Added missing tests"*

## `FdActionBar`

- Implemented mobile variant.
- Added missing tests (e.g.: for mobile variant) + double checked the snapshots.
