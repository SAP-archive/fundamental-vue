You can use `v-model` on `FdButtonGroupButton`. The `value` of a button group is always an array which contains the `value` of each pressed/selected `FdButtonGroupButton`. You associate a value with a button group button by using it's `value`-prop. There are also three selection modes (specified by using the `selectionMode`-prop on the group):\n\n1. `single`: A single button can be pressed/selected at a time.\n2. `multiple`: Multiple buttons can be pressed/selected at a time.\n3. **A custom selection mode function**\n\n**Custom Selection Mode**\n\nIf you have special needs you can specific a custom selection mode function. Simply pass a function to the `selectionMode`-prop. The function will be called with the current selection and the value of button that has just been clicked/tapped. Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.\n\n```javascript\nconst mySelectionMode = (selection, value) => {\n  if(value === \"foo\" || value === \"bar\") {\n    return selection;\n  }\n  const index = selection.indexOf(value);\n  const newSelection = [...selection];\n  if(index >= 0) {\n    // value is already selected, remove it\n    newSelection.splice(index);\n    return newSelection;\n  }\n  // value is not selected, add it\n  return [value, ...newSelection];\n};\n```\n\nThe custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value `foo` or `bar`. Otherwise it acts just like the multiple selection mode.\n</docs>\n<tip>A button group may only contain `FdButtonGroupButton`s. If you use `FdButton` instead, things will not work correctly.\n\n**Important**\n\nMake sure to set `aria-label` on the button group.\n</tip>\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <FdButtonGroup\n      v-model=\"activeButtons\"\n      selectionMode=\"multiple\"\n      aria-label=\"Favorite Color\"\n    >\n      <FdButtonGroupButton value=\"a\">Red</FdButtonGroupButton>\n      <FdButtonGroupButton value=\"b\">Green</FdButtonGroupButton>\n      <FdButtonGroupButton value=\"c\">Blue</FdButtonGroupButton>\n    </FdButtonGroup>\n    <br /><br />\n    <FdButtonGroup\n      v-model=\"activeButtons\"\n      selectionMode=\"multiple\"\n      aria-label=\"Favorite Icon\"\n    >\n      <FdButtonGroupButton icon=\"survey\" value=\"a\" />\n      <FdButtonGroupButton icon=\"pool\" value=\"b\" />\n      <FdButtonGroupButton icon=\"pie-chart\" value=\"c\" />\n    </FdButtonGroup>\n    <br /><br />\n\n    Values of selected Buttons: {{ activeButtons }}\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      activeButtons: []\n    };\n  }\n};\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./4-groups.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./4-groups.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__title = \"Button Groups\"\n}","import mod from \"-!../../../loaders/block-loader.js?optionName=__title!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./4-groups.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../loaders/block-loader.js?optionName=__title!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./4-groups.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__docs = \"<p>Use an <code>FdButtonGroup</code> in order to group buttons. <code>FdButtonGroupButton</code> supports everything (ex. <code>icon</code>, <code>@click(…), …</code>) a regular <code>FdButton</code> does.

Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">const mySelectionMode = (selection, <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span>) =&gt; {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> === <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"foo\\\"</span> || <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> === <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"bar\\\"</span>) {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> selection;\\n  }\\n  const index = selection.indexOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span>);\\n  const newSelection = [...selection];\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(index &gt;= <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>) {\\n    // <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">is</span> already selected,<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\"> remove</span> it\\n    newSelection.splice(index);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> newSelection;\\n  }\\n  // <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">is</span><span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\"> not</span> selected, add it\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> [<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span>, ...newSelection];\\n};</code></pre>\\n<p>The custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code>.

In this case, you do not need the CDN link as this method uses the SASS/SCSS source.</p>\\n<p>To install the Fiori Fundamentals SASS/SCSS source:</p>\\n<pre><code>$ npm <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">install</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">--save fiori-fundamentals</span></code></pre><p>The following assumes the usage of a module bundler such as <a href=\\\"https://webpack.js.org/\\\">webpack</a>. To compile Fiori Fundamentals SASS/SCSS to CSS, two additional packages are required for your bundling process - <a href=\\\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader\\\">sass-loader</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\\\">node-sass</a>. To install these packages as development dependencies:</p>\\n<pre><code>$ npm install sass-loader <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">node</span><span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">-sass</span> --save-dev</code></pre><p>Loading the SCSS and running your project at this point will result in errors relating to the path configuration for icons and fonts. This is a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental#known-issues\\\">known issue</a>.</p>\\n<p>To rectify this, start by creating a new directory (&#39;scss&#39;) in your project&#39;s <code>src</code>. Within this directory, create a main SCSS file (&#39;main.scss&#39;) from which to manage your imports, configurations and customisations.</p>\\n<p>Add the following to the main SCSS file:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-variable\\\">$fd-icons-path</span> : <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/icons/\\\"</span>; <span

It highlights three aspects:\n\n### Sortable Columns\n\nA header can be made sortable by simply flagging it as such using `sortable` and setting `sortBy` to any sortable property of the objects in your `items`-array. By doing so `FdTable` displays sort indicators in the individual column headers. The currently applied sorting can be adjusted by simply clicking on the column headers.\n\n### Custom Cell Content\nUp until now `FdTableCell` was only used to display plain text. However, `FdTableCell` is simply rendering whatever you put in it. This can be anything from emojis (we all like emojis, right? 😀 🥰 ) to images and even custom components.\n\n```html\n// …\n<FdTableCell>{{item.rating}}</FdTableCell>\n// …\n<FdTableCell>{{item.firstName}} {{item.lastName}}</FdTableCell>\n// …\n```\n\nThe two lines above show that in action. The first cell is simply rendering the rating which is just a string with emojis. The second line is combining the first name with the last name in order to render the full name. But as already said: You can put in whatever you want.\n\n### Modifying the displayed Items\n`FdTable` watches for any changes to it's items array.

If `FdTable` encounters an item without an `id`-property, an `id` will be created. The `id` of an item is used to uniquely identify the corresponding item. Each item may contain any additional custom properties.\n\n### FdTable Atonomy\n\n#### The Table Header: `FdTableHeader`\nIt is the responsibility of `FdTable` to render it's header. The header renders column names, sort indicators and custom content. You configure the header of an `FdTable` by using it's `headers`-prop. The `headers`-prop accepts an array which may contain strings or header configuration objects. A plain string inside the `headers`-array will be used as a label for the column header. The complete definition of the `headers`-prop looks like this:\n\n```typescript\ntype Header = {\n  label: string;\n  sortable?: boolean;\n  sortBy?: string;\n  alignment?: TextAlignment; // 'center' or 'default'\n  renderHeader?: HeaderCellRenderFunction; // not yet implemented\n} | string;\n```\n\n#### The Table Row Template: `FdTableRow`\nRows are rendered by `FdTable` on your behalf. This is why you don't specify each row individually. Instead you describe how to render a row (`FdTableRow`) given some context (using Vue's __slot-scope__-mechanism). The object passed to the template has the following shape:\n\n```typescript\n// Object passed to the row template.\ninterface RowSlotProps<T=object> {\n  // Your custom item\n  item: T & { id: string; };\n\n  // True if the corresonding row is currently selected\n  selected: boolean;\n\n  // Call this if you want to change the selection\n  // Of the current row. Typically bound to an\n  // `@change`-event from `FdCheckbox`-instances.\n  changeSelection(selected: boolean, event: Event): void;\n}\n```\n</docs>\n\n<tip>\n`FdTable` is pretty fast.

The items of a table must all be some kind of <code>Object</code>. If <code>FdTable</code> encounters an item without an <code>id</code>-property, an <code>id</code> will be created.

The header renders column names, sort indicators and custom content. You configure the header of an <code>FdTable</code> by using it&#39;s <code>headers</code>-prop. The <code>headers</code>-prop accepts an array which may contain strings or header configuration objects. A plain string inside the <code>headers</code>-array will be used as a label for the column header. The complete definition of the <code>headers</code>-prop looks like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-typescript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">type</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">Header</span> = {\\n  label: <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">string</span>;\\n  sortable?: <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">boolean</span>;\\n  sortBy?: <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">string</span>;\\n  alignment?: TextAlignment; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 'center' or 'default'</span>\\n  renderHeader?: HeaderCellRenderFunction; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// not yet implemented</span>\\n} | <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">string</span>;</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"the-table-row-template-fdtablerow\\\">The Table Row Template: <code>FdTableRow</code></h4>\\n<p>Rows are rendered by <code>FdTable</code> on your behalf. This is why you don&#39;t specify each row individually. Instead you describe how to render a row (<code>FdTableRow</code>) given some context (using Vue&#39;s <strong>slot-scope</strong>-mechanism).
