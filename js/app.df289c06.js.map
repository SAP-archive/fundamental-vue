The <code>headers</code>-prop accepts an array which may contain strings or header configuration objects.

Which means, you don’t need to write a template for every\ncell in a row in case the cell will just display a property’s value. For example, if your headers are <code>['firstName', 'lastName']</code> then by default\nthe 2 cells in each row will display the value of <code>item.firstName</code> and <code>item.lastName</code> respectively.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">It could be that you want the column’s name to be different than the property’s name, which you can still achieve by providing the <code>label</code> and <code>key</code> properties for that column’s header definition.</p>\n<div class=\"fdd-tip\"><div class=\"fdd-tip__body\"><p class=\"fdd-md--p\">If no <code>key</code> was provided and no cell template was written, then the value of <code>label</code> will be used as the property’s name.

It highlights three aspects:</p>\n<h3 class=\"fdd-md--h3\">Sortable Columns</h3>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">A header can be made sortable by simply flagging it as such using <code>sortable</code> and setting <code>sortBy</code> to any sortable property of the objects in your <code>items</code>-array. By doing so <d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-table\"></d-component-api-link> displays sort indicators in the individual column headers. The currently applied sorting can be adjusted by simply clicking on the column headers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"fdd-md--h3\">Custom Cell Content</h3>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Up until now <code>fd-tableCell</code> was only used to display plain text. However, <code>fd-tableCell</code> is simply rendering whatever you put in it. This can be anything from emojis (we all like emojis, right? 😀 🥰 ) to images and even custom components.</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-html\"><code>// …\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>fd-table-cell</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>{{item.rating}}<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>fd-table-cell</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n// …\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>fd-table-cell</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>{{item.firstName}} {{item.lastName}}<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>fd-table-cell</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n// …\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">The two lines above show that in action. The first cell is simply rendering the rating which is just a string with emojis. The second line is combining the first name with the last name in order to render the full name. But as already said: You can put in whatever you want.</p>\n<h3 class=\"fdd-md--h3\">Modifying the displayed Items</h3>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-table\"></d-component-api-link> watches for any changes to it’s items array.

Going forward you have to do so.\\n:::\\n\\nThe most important prop exposed by `fd-table` is called `items`. The items of a table must all be some kind of `Object`. If `fd-table` encounters an item without an `id`-property, an `id` will be created. The `id` of an item is used to uniquely identify the corresponding item. Each item may contain any additional custom properties.\\n\\n### fd-table Atonomy\\n\\n#### The Table Header: `fd-table-header`\\nIt is the responsibility of `fd-table` to render it's header. The header renders column names, sort indicators and custom content. You configure the header of an `fd-table` by using it's `headers`-prop. The `headers`-prop accepts an array which may contain strings or header configuration objects. A plain string inside the `headers`-array will be used as a label for the column header. The complete definition of the `headers`-prop looks like this:\\n\\n```ts\\ntype Header = {\\n  key: string;\\n  label: string;\\n  sortable?: boolean;\\n  sortBy?: string;\\n  alignment?: TextAlignment; // 'center' or 'default'\\n  renderHeader?: HeaderCellRenderFunction; // not yet implemented\\n} | string;\\n```\\n\\n#### The Table Row Template: `fd-table-row`\\nRows are rendered by `fd-table` on your behalf. This is why you don't specify each row individually. Instead you describe how to render a row (`fd-table-row`) given some context (using Vue's __slot-scope__-mechanism). The object passed to the template has the following shape:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Object passed to the row template.\\ninterface RowSlotProps<T=object> {\\n  // Your custom item\\n  item: T & { id: string; };\\n\\n  // True if the corresonding row is currently selected\\n  selected: boolean;\\n\\n  // Call this if you want to change the selection\\n  setSelected(selected: boolean): void;\\n\\n  selectedIds: string[];\\n  canSelect: boolean;\\n  toggle(): void;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n::: tip\\n`fd-table` is pretty fast. However it currently renders everything no matter whether an item is currently displayed or not. The `items`-array should be somewhere around `0` and `5.000`. Otherwise `fd-table` will crash your browser. We are working on removing that limitation. In the meantime you should work around that by using some kind of paging mechanism.\\n:::\\n\\n## Default Table\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"default\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Default Cell Content\\nBy default, the table will use the `header.key` value to render a cell's content. Which means, you don't need to write a template for every\\ncell in a row in case the cell will just display a property's value. For example, if your headers are `['firstName', 'lastName']` then by default\\nthe 2 cells in each row will display the value of `item.firstName` and `item.lastName` respectively.\\n\\nIt could be that you want the column's name to be different than the property's name, which you can still achieve by providing the `label` and `key` properties for that column's header definition.\\n\\n::: tip\\nIf no `key` was provided and no cell template was written, then the value of `label` will be used as the property's name. For example, if headers=`['Some Label']` then the default cell content will be the value of `item['Some Label']`.\\n:::\\n\\nIn the example below, you can see the same rows as the one before without the need to write any templates.\\n\\n::: tip\\nIn case you need to provide a custom cell content then you must wrap it in `fd-table-row` like in the other examples.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"default-no-cells\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Table without Border\\nYou can use `borderless` on `fd-table` in order to disable the outer table border.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"no-border\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Table with Stripes\\n\\nYou can use `striped` on `fd-table` in order enable alternating colored rows.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"stripes\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Example: Adding Entries & Sorting\\n\\nThe example below is a little bit more complex. It highlights three aspects:\\n\\n### Sortable Columns\\n\\nA header can be made sortable by simply flagging it as such using `sortable` and setting `sortBy` to any sortable property of the objects in your `items`-array. By doing so `fd-table` displays sort indicators in the individual column headers. The currently applied sorting can be adjusted by simply clicking on the column headers.\\n\\n### Custom Cell Content\\nUp until now `fd-tableCell` was only used to display plain text. However, `fd-tableCell` is simply rendering whatever you put in it. This can be anything from emojis (we all like emojis, right? 😀 🥰 ) to images and even custom components.\\n\\n```html\\n// …\\n<fd-table-cell>{{item.rating}}</fd-table-cell>\\n// …\\n<fd-table-cell>{{item.firstName}} {{item.lastName}}</fd-table-cell>\\n// …\\n```\\n\\nThe two lines above show that in action. The first cell is simply rendering the rating which is just a string with emojis. The second line is combining the first name with the last name in order to render the full name. But as already said: You can put in whatever you want.\\n\\n### Modifying the displayed Items\\n`fd-table` watches for any changes to it's items array. So you can simply add/remove and modify anything you want.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nIf you modify the `items`-array, make sure that the modification is done in a way compatible with [Vue's reactivity system](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"complex\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Table with fixed Column\\nUse `<fd-table-fixed-wrapper>` on and `fd-table-fixed` in order to make the first column stay fixed when scrolling.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nUsing fixed columns is still experimental.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"fixed-col\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Selection Modes\\n\\n`fd-table` supports three different selection modes:\\n\\n1. Selection mode `none` (default): Rows are not selectable in any way.\\n2. Selection mode `single`: There can only ever be a single selected row.\\n3. Selection mode `multiple`: Multiple rows can be selected.\\n\\nUse the `selectionMode`-prop to set the selection mode of your choice.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"selection-modes\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Performance Test\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\n`fd-table` is not yet capable of displaying huge data sets. The current limit is around `1.000`-`5.000` rows (depending on the browser, number of elements currently present in the DOM, number of columns, displayed data, …).\\n\\n**If you want to display a lot of data consider using** `fd-virtualized-list`.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"performance-test\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Custom Row Content\\n\\nYou can put other components (for example a simple `fd-button`) in `fd-table-cell`.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nIf a component you put inside an `fd-tableCell` subscribes to `@click`-events, you will most likely wand to use the `.stop`-modifier. Otherwise clicking a button will toggle the selection of the enclosing row.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"with-components\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Dynamic Columns\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"dynamic-columns\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Select by Clicking on Row\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"select-by-row-click\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\"","export default \"<template>\\n  <div>\\n    <fd-calendar />\\n  </div>\\n</template>\\n\"","export default \"<template>\\n  <div>\\n    <p>\\n      Predicate:\\n      <code>{{ predicate }}</code>\\n    </p>\\n    <fd-search-input v-model=\\\"predicate\\\" placeholder=\\\"Search\\\" />\\n  </div>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nexport default {\\n  data: () => ({ predicate: \\\"Apples and Oranges\\\" })\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","export default {\"componentDesc\":{\"default\":[]},\"name\":\"fd-shell-footer\",\"props\":[{\"name\":\"fixed\",\"type\":\"Boolean\",\"describe\":[],\"default\":\"false\"}],\"slots\":[{\"name\":\"default\",\"describe\":\"\",\"backerDesc\":\"\",\"bindings\":{},\"scoped\":false,\"target\":\"template\"}]};","export default \"---\\nfdRelatedComponents:\\n  - fd-side-nav\\n  - fd-side-nav-list\\n  - fd-side-nav-item\\n  - fd-side-nav-link\\n  - fd-side-nav-group\\n  - fd-side-nav-group-title\\n  - fd-side-nav-sub-list\\n  - fd-side-nav-sub-item\\n  - fd-side-nav-sub-link\\n  - fd-side-nav-icon\\n---\\n\\n# Side Navigation\\n\\n## Dynamic Side Navigation\\n\\n`fd-side-nav-list` requires  which you set via the `items`-prop.

Just give each modal a name (using the <code>name</code>-prop) and pass this to the <code>open</code>-function.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>Manually showing the modal</strong></p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Of course you can also manually show or close the modal by simply calling the corresponding methods in it:</p>\n<ul class=\"fdd-md--ul\">\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><code>show(event?)</code>: shows the modal.</li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><code>close(event?)</code>: closes the modal.</li>\n</ul>\n</div></div><h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Default Modal</h2>\n<d-example name=\"default-modal\">\n</d-example>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Fullscreen Modal</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">The modal dimensions can be controlled through the width and height properties of the configuration object.

This allows you to set all `fd-popover`-related props. The example below shows how to set the `placement`-prop. Since `fd-menu-popover` has no custom `placement`-prop it will simply pass it to the popover.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu-popover-placement\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\"","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-0!../../../../node_modules/css-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-1!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../../node_modules/sass-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--8-oneOf-1-2!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!../../../../loaders/fd-component-api-loader.js!./component-name.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=scss&\";

You would most likely want to set a different position for each group, which can be done using the <code>position</code> prop. This prop accepts an array of 2 strings to set the location and orientation. The default value is <code>[&quot;top&quot;, &quot;right&quot;]</code> (possible values are: <code>[&quot;bottom&quot;, &quot;top&quot;]</code> for the first element and <code>[&quot;left&quot;, &quot;right&quot;, &quot;center&quot;]</code> for the second).</p>\n<div class=\"fdd-tip\"><div class=\"fdd-tip__body\"><p class=\"fdd-md--p\">You can also pass in a <code>custom-styles</code> prop to the <d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-notifications\"></d-component-api-link> to control some of the css properties.

fd-calendar\\n---\\n\\n# Calendar\\n\\nThe `fd-calendar` component is usually displayed inside an `fd-popover`. Scroll down to see an example if you are unsure how to do that. Even though the calendar is a very complex component getting started is as easy as pie. This\\n\\n```html\\n<fd-calendar />\\n```\\n\\ngets you the default calendar displayed below. `fd-calendar` has a lot of customization points. Please refer to the examples below for details.\\n\\n## Default Calendar\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\n`fd-calendar` is still under heavy development. Things might break.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"default\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar Rangle Selection\\n\\nBy default you can only select a single date. To change that simply set the `selectionMode` to 'range'.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"selection-range\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar with blocked Items\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"blocked-items\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar with Disabled Items\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"disabled-items\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar & `v-model`\\n\\n`fd-calendar` supports `v-model`. The example below shows two calendars bound to the same model.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"bindings\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar in a Popover\\n\\nCalendars work best when displayed in a popover. You can use `fd-popover` for that.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"popover\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar with custom Names\\n\\n::: tip\\nYou can customize the names (day of week and month of year)  displayed in the calendar by using the props `dayNames` and `monthNames`. This is also how you would implement i18n.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"custom-names\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Controlling Calendar Buttons\\nThe `hasNext` and `hasPrevious` props can be used to control the next and previous buttons in the calendar header. Those props are functions that return either `true` or `false`. Returning `false` disables the corresponding button. The calendar passes an object containing the `min` and `max` date of the currently displayed month.\\n\\n::: tip\\nThe example below let's you go three month into the future and past by using the previous and next buttons in the header. By using the year and month picker the user can still go to months/years that are not reachable with previous and next buttons.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"buttons\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Controlling the First Day of Week\\n\\nBy default the first day of the week is **Sunday**. You can customize that by using the `first-day-of-week`-prop. `first-day-of-week` accepts a number between `0` (default) and `6`. By setting `first-day-of-week` to `1` you basically set the first day of the week to **Monday**.\\n\\n::: tip\\nIf you customize weekday names by using the `day-names`-prop you do that independently from `first-day-of-week`. This means that even though you may have set a different `first-day-of-week`, the first name specified in `day-names` is always and will always be the name for **Sunday**.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"first-day-of-week\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Default Date\\n\\nBy default the calendar displays the current month. You can change that by setting  `default-value` to a custom date value.\\n\\n\\n::: tip\\n`default-value` accepts values of type `Number`, `String` and `Date`. The `Number` or `String` you pass to `default-value` simply be forwarded to the `Date`'s constructor.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"default-date\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar without the Header\\n\\nYou can hide the header by setting `header-visible` to `false`. Without a header it is hard to tell which date is displayed/selected. Thus it is a good idea to render the currently displayed/selected date separately.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"no-header\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var

The data that is passed as an `items` array, is nested. Meaning that a node can have multiple child node. If that's the case, then it will be expandable. \\n\\n\\n## Simple Tree\\n\\nThe most simple usage of the tree is passing it an array where each object has a `name` and `children` property.\\n<d-example name=\\\"default\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Slots\\n\\nUsing the `prepend` and `label` slots, with the same data from the example above, we can customize our tree to look like an actual file explorer. The `prepend` slot allows you to control what should be rendered before a node's label. In the `label` slot you can really pass any element that you like depending on your use case.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"file-explorer\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n\\n## Props\\n\\nBy default,the tree will look for a `name` property to use it as node label and a `children` property to extract a node's children. However if you already have objects with tree-like structure, you don't need to transform them into an array of objects following the default naming. You can use the props to specify the path to the `name` and `children` properties. You can even use nested property names, just like in the example below, in the format of `'nestedPropertyName.deepProperty'`.

Offscreen data is not rendered. Thus scrolling through your list should be very efficient. `fd-virtualized-list` depends on a 3rd-party (open source) library called [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller). *Fundamental Vue* does not include a copy of [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller). It is up to you to properly setup [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller).\\n\\nYour `items`-array must have some kind of unique identifier. Use the `key-field`-prop to specify the name of the property.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nYou also have to install [vue-observe-visibility](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-observe-visibility) because `fd-virtualized-list` requires the `v-observe-visibility`-directive.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Simple Virtualized List\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-default\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Lazy Loading Virtualized List\\n\\n\\nYou don't have to tell `fd-virtualized-list` all of your items in advance. You can simply give `fd-virtualized-list` only a few items, just enough to fill it up completely. Once the user has scrolled to the bottom of the list you are asked to provide more items.\\n\\nThis works by passing an item loader by using the `load-more-items`-prop. Typically this prop is simply a method in your component.\\n\\nThis method will automatically be alled by `fd-virtualized-list` once more items are required in order to let the user continue to scroll.\\n\\nYour method that loads more items is invoked with a callback that has to be called. A typical method that loads more items and can be used in conjunction with `load-more-items` may look like this:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n  data() {\\n    return { items: [/* your items */]}\\n  },\\n  methods: {\\n    loadMoreItems(done) {\\n      // Load more items…\\n      const newItems = this.fetchItemsFromBackend();\\n      // Add the new items to your items-array:\\n      this.items.push(...newItems);\\n      // Call done.\\n      done()\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBetween `loadMoreItems` is invoked and you calling `done` `fd-virtualized-list` is in a loading state and displays a spinner (`fd-spinner`) at the very bottom. This can be customized by specifying a custom `loading`-slot.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nThe example below loads new items for ever and ever. You will never reach the end. Sorry.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-loading-more\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Initial Load\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-initial-load\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Resetting a Virtualized List\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-reset\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Filtering a Virtualized List\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-filter\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Adding/Removing Items from a Virtualized List\\n\\nYou can modify the `items`-array directly in order to add/remove items. The rules as described in the [Vue Reactivity Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html) still apply.\\n\\nIf you click on `[Add Item]` a new item will be appened to the beginning of the `items`-array.\\nIf an item is selected, clicking on `[Add Item]` will insert an item right below the current selection.\\nClicking on `[Remove Item]` will remove the currently selected item from the list.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-mutate\\\">\\n</d-example>\"","export default \"---\\nfdRelatedComponents:\\n  - fd-date-input\\n---\\n\\n# Date Input\\n\\n`fd-date-input` can be used to get date + date range inputs from a user.

You can use `v-model` to control the visibility of the alert.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"vmodel\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n# Notifications Service\\n\\nWhen you use `FundamentalVue` we automatically register `fdNotifications` on the vue instance and `$fdNotifications` on the prototype. This service contains functions which will allow you to show/hide notifications from any component.\\nTo use it, you have to first create an instance of `fd-notifications` component and then you can call the functions on `this.$fdNotifications`.\\nThe tree available functions are:\\n- **hideAll(group?)**: dismisses all the notifications from `<group>` if a group name was passed as a param, otherwise dismisses all notifications from all the groups\\n- **hide({group?, id})**: dismisses the notification from group `<group>` with id `<id>`\\n- **show(opts)**: creates a new notification and returns the created notification's `id`\\n\\n::: tip\\nit is recommended to put the `fd-notifications` component on the highest level possible so that all subcomponents can use it. If notifications will be used across all of your app then place it in your root app component.\\n:::\\n\\nBelow is the type definition of the **show(opts)** function.\\n \\n```js\\ninterface NewNotificationOpts {\\n    // if not provided then a random one will be automatically generated\\n    id?: string;\\n    // specifies the target group, in case the user has multiple named \\n    // notifications groups defined.\\n    group?: string;\\n    // can be html content\\n    title?: string;\\n    // can be an html content\\n    content: string;\\n    // the type that will be forwarded to the underlying alert component\\n    type: NotificationTypes;\\n    // determines whether the user can dismiss a notification by clicking on it\\n    // default value: true\\n    dismissible?: boolean;\\n    // determines whether the notification should be dismissed automatically or not\\n    // default value: false\\n    permanent: boolean;\\n    // if set, the notification will be automatically cleared after <timeout>ms\\n    // in case `permanent` was set to `true` and a timeout was set, then the \\n    // `permanent` property will be ignored\\n    // default value (in case `permanent: false` and no value assigned): 2000\\n    timeout?: number;\\n    // optional callback function that will receive the notification opts object\\n    // as a param and will be called once the notification has been removed from the list\\n    onDismiss?: Function;\\n}\\n\\ntype NotificationTypes = \\\"default\\\" | \\\"warning\\\" | \\\"error\\\" | \\\"information\\\" | \\\"success\\\";\\n```\\n\\n\\n## Defaults\\n<d-example fullscreen-only name=\\\"notifications-default\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Multiple Groups and Positions\\nYou can create multiple instances of `fd-notifications` component each with a different configuration. Using the `group` prop you can set the name of the underlying notifications group so that you could target it when calling the **fdNotifications.show(opts)** method. You would most likely want to set a different position for each group, which can be done using the `position` prop. This prop accepts an array of 2 strings to set the location and orientation. The default value is `[\\\"top\\\", \\\"right\\\"]` (possible values are: `[\\\"bottom\\\", \\\"top\\\"]` for the first element and `[\\\"left\\\", \\\"right\\\", \\\"center\\\"]` for the second).\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nYou can also pass in a `custom-styles` prop to the `fd-notifications` to control some of the css properties. By default the property `maxWidth: 400px` is set, and you can override it with the aforementioned prop.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example fullscreen-only name=\\\"notifications-group\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n \"","export default \"<template>\\n  <fd-tile-grid>\\n    <fd-tile>\\n      <fd-tile-content><fd-tile-title>Lorem ipsum</fd-tile-title></fd-tile-content>\\n    </fd-tile>\\n\\n    <fd-tile>\\n      <fd-tile-content><fd-tile-title>Lorem ipsum</fd-tile-title></fd-tile-content>\\n    </fd-tile>\\n\\n    <fd-tile>\\n      <fd-tile-content><fd-tile-title>Lorem ipsum</fd-tile-title></fd-tile-content>\\n    </fd-tile>\\n\\n    <fd-tile>\\n      <fd-tile-content><fd-tile-title>Lorem ipsum</fd-tile-title></fd-tile-content>\\n    </fd-tile>\\n\\n    <fd-tile>\\n      <fd-tile-content><fd-tile-title>Lorem ipsum</fd-tile-title></fd-tile-content>\\n    </fd-tile>\\n\\n    <fd-tile>\\n      <fd-tile-content><fd-tile-title>Lorem ipsum</fd-tile-title></fd-tile-content>\\n    </fd-tile>\\n  </fd-tile-grid>\\n</template>\\n\"","export default {\"componentDesc\":{\"default\":[]},\"name\":\"fd-section-header\",\"slots\":[{\"name\":\"default\",\"describe\":\"\",\"backerDesc\":\"\",\"bindings\":{},\"scoped\":false,\"target\":\"template\"}]};","export default \"---\\nfdRelatedComponents:\\n  - fd-field-set\\n  - fd-form-group\\n  - fd-form-item\\n  - fd-form-label\\n  - fd-form-message\\n  - fd-form-set\\n  - fd-input\\n  - fd-input-group\\n  - fd-legend\\n  - fd-select\\n  - fd-text-area\\n---\\n\\n# Form\\n\\n## Binding\\n\\n::: tip\\n`fd-input` supports `v-model` and thus you can easily create bi-directional bindings.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"binding\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Input States\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"states\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Checkboxes\\nYou can bind multiple checkboxes to a single array.

In this case, you do not need the CDN link as this method uses the SASS/SCSS source.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">To install the Fiori Fundamentals SASS/SCSS source:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-sh\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> --save fiori-fundamentals\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">The following assumes the usage of a module bundler such as <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">webpack</a>. To compile Fiori Fundamentals SASS/SCSS to CSS, two additional packages are required for your bundling process - <a href=\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader\">sass-loader</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\">node-sass</a>. To install these packages as development dependencies:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-sh\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> sass-loader node-sass --save-dev\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Loading the SCSS and running your project at this point will result in errors relating to the path configuration for icons and fonts. This is a <a href=\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental#known-issues\">known issue</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">To rectify this, start by creating a new directory (‘scss’) in your project’s <code>src</code>. Within this directory, create a main SCSS file (‘main.scss’) from which to manage your imports, configurations and customisations.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Add the following to the main SCSS file:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-scss\"><code><span class=\"token comment\">// If you are targeting IE 11 uncomment the following line.</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// $fd-support-css-var-fallback: true;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// should be declared before the scss import</span>\n<span class=\"token property\"><span class=\"token variable\">$fd-icons-path</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/icons/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token property\"><span class=\"token variable\">$fd-scss-font-path</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/fonts/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">@import</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/all.scss\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Import the main SCSS file in your <code>App.js</code> style block to add Fiori Fundamentals styles to your project.</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-scss\"><code>&lt;style lang=<span class=\"token string\">'scss'</span>>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">@import</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"./scss/main.scss\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// …</span>\n&lt;/style>\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">You can now use the <a href=\"https://sap.github.io/fundamental-vue/\">Documentation</a> to browse the components currently available with Fundamental Vue.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">To use a Fundamental Vue component, paste the desired code snippet from the Playground and configure it as necessary:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-xml\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>fd-alert</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">dismissible</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    Happy building! 🚀\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>fd-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Versioning</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">The <code>fundamental-vue</code> library follows <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning</a>.

Just run <code>node scripts/new_component.js &lt;componentName&gt;</code> and it will create\nall the necessary files and make the imports. After executing it and building the doc you should see a section for your new component with some placeholder text.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>P.S:</strong> please use the <code>lowerCamelCase</code> naming convention when passing the new component’s name</p>\n</div></div><h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Creating the files for the actual Component</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">For the purpose of this guide, lets assume that you want to create a component called <code>Flower</code>. Create a folder that contains all of your files. For example:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> ui/src/components/Flower\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> ui/src/components/Flower/index.ts\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> ui/src/components/Flower/Flower.vue\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> ui/src/components/Flower/Blossom.vue\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> ui/src/components/Flower/Util.ts\n</code></pre>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Implementing the Component</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>ui/src/components/Flower/Flower.vue</strong></p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-xml\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">:style</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>style<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>I am a flower<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>script</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">lang</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>ts<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\nimport Vue from \"vue\";\n\nexport default Vue.extend({\n  name: \"FdFlower\",\n  props: {\n    color: String\n  },\n  computed: {\n    styles() {\n      return {\n        backgroundColor: this.color\n      };\n    }\n  }\n});\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Exporting the new Component</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">You have to export the new component:</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>ui/src/components/Flower/index.ts</strong></p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> Flower <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"./Flower.vue\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> pluginify <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"@/util\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"token function\">pluginify</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>Flower<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> Flower <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Documenting the new Component</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">In order to make your component available to the public you have to document the component. A properly documented component consists of at least two things:</p>\n<ul class=\"fdd-md--ul\">\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\">Examples</li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\">API Documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Documenting the new Component: Examples</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">In order to create a example for your new component create the necessary files:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> docs/src/pages/Flower\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> docs/src/pages/Flower/0-default.vue\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> docs/src/pages/Flower/index.ts\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Examples are implemented as single file components (in our case <code>docs/src/pages/Flower/0-default.vue</code>) because this is what most Vue developers are using. You can put anything you want in the vue-file: a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>-block, a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>-block and a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>-block.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Fundamental Vue examples may contain additional documentation specific blocks.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>_baseline.json:</strong>\ndocs/src/api/_baseline.json</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Here you add the documentation that needs to be added for your component; like the possible slots, props, events, mixins etc.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>pages.json:</strong>\ndocs/src/pages/pages.json</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Here you add the page configuration in which the documentation will be shown; like the title that comes on the left section, the files that need to be read and stuff.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Lets simply implement the most basic example possible:</p>\n<h3 class=\"fdd-md--h3\">Simple Example</h3>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>docs/src/pages/Flower/0-default.vue</strong></p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-xml\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>FdFlower</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">color</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>red<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">You can include a <code>script</code> and/or <code>style</code> section if needed. If you declare custom styles make sure to make your <code>style</code>-section scoped.</p>\n<h3 class=\"fdd-md--h3\">Improved Example</h3>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">As already mentioned in the paragraph above, you can improve your example by using addional blocks. Namely:</p>\n<ul class=\"fdd-md--ul\">\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><code>&lt;title&gt;Example Title&lt;/title&gt;</code>: Specify a title for your example. The title is displayed in a big font above your example.</li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><code>&lt;docs&gt;Potentially long example description&lt;/docs&gt;</code>: Describe the example in detail. This is displayed directly below the title. <strong>Supports Markdown</strong></li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><code>&lt;tip&gt;Short but useful tip related to the example/component.&lt;/tip&gt;</code> If there is something important, especially useful or good to know fact use the <code>&lt;tip&gt;</code>-block.

Further down you will find examples that show how to use multiple lists.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>Events</strong></p>\n<ul class=\"fdd-md--ul\">\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-menu-item\"></d-component-api-link> emits <code>click</code> when clicked.</li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\">Both, <d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-menu-list\"></d-component-api-link> and <d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-menu\"></d-component-api-link> emit <code>select</code>-events every time an item was clicked. The payload is the item itself. They act as some kind of event aggregator which is useful if you don’t care about the context of the clicked items so much.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Default Menu</h2>\n<d-example name=\"menu\">\n</d-example>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Menu Item with Link</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong><d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-menu-item\"></d-component-api-link> is smart:</strong></p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-menu-item\"></d-component-api-link> looks at what you put in it. If you have an item with just text, <d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-menu-item\"></d-component-api-link> will detect that and automatically wrap it with an anchor-element.

fd-tree\\n---\\n\\n# Object Tree\\n\\nYou can use `fd-object-tree` to display an object or a json string in a visual hierarchy. This component traverses your object's properties recursively and constructs an array of objects that can be handled by the `fd-tree` component.\\n\\n\\n## Simple Usage\\nThe most simple way to use it is just to pass your object as the `object` prop value or your json string as the `json` prop value.\\n\\nUsing an object\\n<d-example name=\\\"default\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\nWe can also get the same result if we pass the serialized version of the same object\\n<d-example name=\\\"json\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n**Notes**: \\n- If you pass values to both `object` and `json` props, the former will be checked first\\n- The component loops over the properties using the `Object.getOwnPropertyNames(obj)` method. Which means that the properties on the prototype chain will not be listed.\\n- By default, not all properties are serializable (e.g: functions), therefore you might notice some differences between the object and the json versions\\n\\n## Props\\nBesides the props mentioned above, the component also exposes `ignore-properties` and `root-name` props. The former is an array of strings containing the names of the properties that should not examined, whereas the latter is just the label to be used for the top-most root node.\\n\\nBelow is an example using these props to hide the `excluded` property from the object.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"props\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n**Note**: be careful with the `ignore-properties` because it will be used on the nested properties as well. For example, if you have `:ignore-properties=\\\"['a']\\\"` and `:object=\\\"{a: 1, b: {a: 2, c:3}}\\\"`, then the `a` on both the root and the `b` property will be ignored. \"","export default \"<template>\\n  <div>\\n    <p>\\n      <strong>Selected Fruit:</strong>\\n    </p>\\n    <p>{{ fruit || \\\"none\\\" }}</p>\\n    <fd-combobox v-model=\\\"fruit\\\" placeholder=\\\"Pick your Fruit of the day\\\">\\n      <template #default>\\n        <fd-menu-item value=\\\"Apple\\\">Apple</fd-menu-item>\\n        <fd-menu-item value=\\\"Banana\\\">Banana</fd-menu-item>\\n        <fd-menu-item value=\\\"Cherry\\\">Cherry</fd-menu-item>\\n      </template>\\n    </fd-combobox>\\n  </div>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nexport default {\\n  data: () => ({ fruit: null })\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',[_c('h1',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h1\"},[_vm._v(\"Link\")]),_vm._m(0),_c('d-example',{attrs:{\"name\":\"default\"}}),_c('d-related-components-section',{attrs:{\"component-names\":_vm.fdFrontmatter.fdRelatedComponents}})],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',{staticClass:\"fdd-tip\"},[_c('div',{staticClass:\"fdd-tip__body\"},[_c('p',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--p\"},[_vm._v(\"You can provide the visible title of the link by using a default slot or by using the \"),_c('code',[_vm._v(\"title\")]),_vm._v(\"-prop.

You can use <code>v-model</code> on <code>fd-buttonGroupButton</code>. The <code>value</code> of a button group is always an array which contains the <code>value</code> of each pressed/selected <code>fd-buttonGroupButton</code>. You associate a value with a button group button by using it’s <code>value</code>-prop. There are also three selection modes (specified by using the <code>selectionMode</code>-prop on the group):</p>\n<ol class=\"fdd-md--ol\">\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><code>single</code>: A single button can be pressed/selected at a time.</li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><code>multiple</code>: Multiple buttons can be pressed/selected at a time.</li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><strong>A custom selection mode function</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>Custom Selection Mode</strong></p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">If you have special needs you can specific a custom selection mode function. Simply pass a function to the <code>selectionMode</code>-prop. The function will be called with the current selection and the value of button that has just been clicked/tapped. Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">mySelectionMode</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">selection<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> value</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>value <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"foo\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">||</span> value <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"bar\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> selection<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> index <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> selection<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">indexOf</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>value<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> newSelection <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">...</span>selection<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>index <span class=\"token operator\">>=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// value is already selected, remove it</span>\n    newSelection<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">splice</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>index<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> newSelection<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// value is not selected, add it</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>value<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>newSelection<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">The custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code>.

You should show a popover/menu in when this event is emitted.\\n\\n::: tip\\n`fd-split-button` does not display a menu or popover when clicked. It is up to you to set that up.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"split-button-playground\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Split Button With Menu\\n\\n`fd-split-button` works perfectly together with `fd-menu-popover`.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"split-button-popover\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Button States\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"states\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Button Groups\\n\\nUse an `fd-buttonGroup` in order to group buttons. `fd-buttonGroupButton` supports everything (ex. `icon`, `@click(…), …`) a regular `fd-button` does. You can use `v-model` on `fd-buttonGroupButton`. The `value` of a button group is always an array which contains the `value` of each pressed/selected `fd-buttonGroupButton`. You associate a value with a button group button by using it's `value`-prop. There are also three selection modes (specified by using the `selectionMode`-prop on the group):\\n\\n1. `single`: A single button can be pressed/selected at a time.\\n2. `multiple`: Multiple buttons can be pressed/selected at a time.\\n3. **A custom selection mode function**\\n\\n**Custom Selection Mode**\\n\\nIf you have special needs you can specific a custom selection mode function. Simply pass a function to the `selectionMode`-prop. The function will be called with the current selection and the value of button that has just been clicked/tapped. Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst mySelectionMode = (selection, value) => {\\n  if(value === \\\"foo\\\" || value === \\\"bar\\\") {\\n    return selection;\\n  }\\n  const index = selection.indexOf(value);\\n  const newSelection = [...selection];\\n  if(index >= 0) {\\n    // value is already selected, remove it\\n    newSelection.splice(index);\\n    return newSelection;\\n  }\\n  // value is not selected, add it\\n  return [value, ...newSelection];\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThe custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value `foo` or `bar`. Otherwise it acts just like the multiple selection mode.\\n\\n::: tip\\nA button group may only contain `fd-button-group-button`-instances. If you use `fd-button` instead, things will not work correctly.\\n\\n**Important**\\n\\nMake sure to set `aria-label` on the button group.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"groups\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n\\n## Compact Button Groups\\n\\n::: tip\\nThe compact size is only used on desktop and it is full size when used on a touch device.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"groups-compact\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('fd-tile-grid',{attrs:{\"col\":5}},[_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1)],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./tile-grid--col-5-with-tile.vue?vue&type=template&id=2e304e44&\"\nvar script = {}\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('fd-menu',{attrs:{\"canHaveAddon\":\"\"}},[_c('fd-menu-list',[_c('fd-menu-item',[_vm._v(\"Option 1\")]),_c('fd-menu-item',[_c('span',{staticClass:\"sap-icon--accept\",attrs:{\"slot\":\"addon\"},slot:\"addon\"}),_vm._v(\" Option 2 \")]),_c('fd-menu-item',[_vm._v(\"Option 3\")]),_c('fd-menu-item',[_vm._v(\"Option 4\")])],1)],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./menu-addon.vue?vue&type=template&id=475ce612&\"\nvar script = {}\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',[_c('h1',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h1\"},[_vm._v(\"fd-side-nav-link\")]),_c('h2',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h2\"},[_vm._v(\"Props\")]),_c('h3',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h3\"},[_vm._v(\"asRouterLink\")]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--p\"},[_c('strong',[_vm._v(\"Type:\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('code',[_vm._v(\"Boolean\")])]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--p\"},[_c('strong',[_vm._v(\"Default:\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('code',[_vm._v(\"false\")])]),_c('h2',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h2\"},[_vm._v(\"Slots\")]),_c('h3',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h3\"},[_vm._v(\"default\")])])}]\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!../../../loaders/fd-component-api-loader.js!./SideNavLink.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&fddApi\";

A menu contains one or more `fd-menu-list`s. Lists in turn contain `fd-menu-item`s. *This separation allows you to put similar items in the same group and bring order to chaos*. Further down you will find examples that show how to use multiple lists.\\n\\n**Events**\\n\\n- `fd-menu-item` emits `click` when clicked.\\n- Both, `fd-menu-list` and `fd-menu` emit `select`-events every time an item was clicked. The payload is the item itself. They act as some kind of event aggregator which is useful if you don't care about the context of the clicked items so much.\\n\\n## Default Menu\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Menu Item with Link\\n\\n\\n**`fd-menu-item` is smart:**\\n\\n`fd-menu-item` looks at what you put in it. If you have an item with just text, `fd-menu-item` will detect that and automatically wrap it with an anchor-element. So this:\\n\\n```html\\n<fd-menu-item>click me</fd-menu-item>\\n```\\n\\nwill yield the same *HTML* as\\n\\n```html\\n<fd-menu-item>\\n  <fd-menu-link>click me</fd-menu-link>\\n</fd-menu-item>\\n```\\n\\nIf you put anything other than just plain text inside `fd-menu-item` then this automatism won't kick in.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\n`fd-menuLink` is just a simple wrapper around the standard `a`-element. This allows you to further customize the menu item (`href`, `target`, …).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menuitem-link\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Menu w/ Group\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu-group\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Menu w/ addon before\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu-addon\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Menu w/ separated items\\n\\nUse the `separated` modifier on `fd-menu-list` to add separators between the items.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu-separated\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Menu Highlight\\n\\n`fd-menu` currently has a limited API to control the highlighting-state. At this moment only two methods are exposed:\\n\\n1. `highlightNextItem()`: Highlights the next menu item.\\n2. `highlightPreviousItem()`: Highlights the previous menu item.\\n\\nYou should rarely need to manually call those methods. They are mainly used to support keyboard navigation.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nBy setting `highlights-selection` to `true` you tell `fd-menu` that selected items should be highlighted. A highlighted menu item is rendered with a background colored in light-blue.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu-selection\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var

default \"---\\nfdRelatedComponents:\\n  - fd-master-details\\n---\\n# Master Details\\n\\nThis component provides a standardized master-details layout. The master section contains a list, whereas the details section's content is completely up to the developer. The `fd-master-details` component, exposes multiple props and slots allowing the consumer to customize the layout.\\n\\n\\n## How does it work?\\n\\nThe master section uses either `fd-list-group` or `fd-virtualized-list` to render the `master-items` array. Once an item of the master list is clicked, an event is triggered internally, and the selected item will be passed to the `selection-handler`. The result of this function will then be passed to the `details-content` scoped slot where the consumer can render anything they want. By default, the `selection-handler` is just a function that returns the item that was passed to it. However, you can pass your own function that could do something like fetching details from an API based on the item's id.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\n**Note**: on devices with a small screen (you can control the breakpoints), the `details` section's content will be automatically\\nplaced inside an `fd-modal` allowing the `master` section to take up all the available width.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n\\n## Simple example\\n\\nThe simplest way to use it, would be by passing the `master-items` prop and populating the `details-content` slot (since it is empty by default). \\n  \\n<d-example name=\\\"default\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Customizing the Layout\\n\\nThe component exposes `master-width` and `gap` props to control the with of the master column and that of the gap between the 2 columns. By default, the `master-width` is set to 50% and the `gap` is set to 0. The details column will always automatically take up the remaining space.\\nYou can pass the size that you want is either pixels or percentage, e.g: '50%', '20px'...\\n\\nUse the sliders in the example below to see how the layout changes when changing the aforementioned props \\n<d-example name=\\\"layout\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Using a Virtualized List\\n\\nAs we have mentioned before, the component can either user `fd-list-group` or `fd-virtualized-list` under the hood. To use the virtualized list, you need to set the `use-virtualized-list` prop to `true`. You can then pass an object that contains all the props that you would usually pass to the `fd-virtualized-list`. The `fd-master-details` uses a default configuration object which means you can choose to only pass the properties that you wish to override. The defaults are:  \\n\\n```js\\ndefaultVirtualizedListConfig: {\\n        keyField: \\\"id\\\",\\n        minItemSize: 50,\\n        loadMoreItems: function(done) {\\n          done();\\n        }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\n**Note**: unlike the regular list, the virtualized one needs a unique keyField, therefore make sure that your array items have that.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n\\n## Slots\\n\\nThis component exposes multiple slots allowing you to customize the contents of the sections' title and content. You can see how the slots are positioned in the image below. \\n\\n![master-details-slots](../../../../public/images/master-details-slots.png)\\n\\nBelow is an example making full use of all the available slots (it also simulates an API call by sleeping for 800ms to showcase the `loading` slot)\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"full\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Mobile Settings\\n\\nIn order to ensure a more responsive design, the component exposes `auto-open-modal`, `mobile-modal-styles` and `mobile-breakpoints` props allowing the developer to control when should the `details` switch to an `fd-modal` and how should the modal look like. By default, the modal will be fullscreen and will be triggered on the `Breakpoints.XSmall` breakpoint.\\n\\nBelow is an example that makes use of these props to customize the mobile behavior of the component.\\n \\n<d-example name=\\\"mobile\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n\\n## Fullscreen\\n\\nThis could also be used as the main fullscreen layout for your page or application. By setting the `fullscreen` prop to `true` the component will automatically take up all the screen and apply some styles.\\n\\n<d-example fullscreen-only name=\\\"fullscreen\\\">\\n</d-example>\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var
