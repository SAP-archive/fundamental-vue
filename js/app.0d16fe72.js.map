It highlights three aspects:</p>\n<h3 class=\"fdd-md--h3\">Sortable Columns</h3>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">A header can be made sortable by simply flagging it as such using <code>sortable</code> and setting <code>sortBy</code> to any sortable property of the objects in your <code>items</code>-array. By doing so <d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-table\"></d-component-api-link> displays sort indicators in the individual column headers. The currently applied sorting can be adjusted by simply clicking on the column headers.</p>\n<h3 class=\"fdd-md--h3\">Custom Cell Content</h3>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Up until now <code>fd-tableCell</code> was only used to display plain text. However, <code>fd-tableCell</code> is simply rendering whatever you put in it. This can be anything from emojis (we all like emojis, right? 😀 🥰 ) to images and even custom components.</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-html\"><code>// …\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>fd-table-cell</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>{{item.rating}}<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>fd-table-cell</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n// …\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>fd-table-cell</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>{{item.firstName}} {{item.lastName}}<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>fd-table-cell</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n// …\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">The two lines above show that in action. The first cell is simply rendering the rating which is just a string with emojis. The second line is combining the first name with the last name in order to render the full name. But as already said: You can put in whatever you want.</p>\n<h3 class=\"fdd-md--h3\">Modifying the displayed Items</h3>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-table\"></d-component-api-link> watches for any changes to it’s items array.

Going forward you have to do so.\\n:::\\n\\nThe most important prop exposed by `fd-table` is called `items`. The items of a table must all be some kind of `Object`. If `fd-table` encounters an item without an `id`-property, an `id` will be created. The `id` of an item is used to uniquely identify the corresponding item. Each item may contain any additional custom properties.\\n\\n### fd-table Atonomy\\n\\n#### The Table Header: `fd-table-header`\\nIt is the responsibility of `fd-table` to render it's header. The header renders column names, sort indicators and custom content. You configure the header of an `fd-table` by using it's `headers`-prop. The `headers`-prop accepts an array which may contain strings or header configuration objects. A plain string inside the `headers`-array will be used as a label for the column header. The complete definition of the `headers`-prop looks like this:\\n\\n```ts\\ntype Header = {\\n  label: string;\\n  sortable?: boolean;\\n  sortBy?: string;\\n  alignment?: TextAlignment; // 'center' or 'default'\\n  renderHeader?: HeaderCellRenderFunction; // not yet implemented\\n} | string;\\n```\\n\\n#### The Table Row Template: `fd-table-row`\\nRows are rendered by `fd-table` on your behalf. This is why you don't specify each row individually. Instead you describe how to render a row (`fd-table-row`) given some context (using Vue's __slot-scope__-mechanism). The object passed to the template has the following shape:\\n\\n```typescript\\n// Object passed to the row template.\\ninterface RowSlotProps<T=object> {\\n  // Your custom item\\n  item: T & { id: string; };\\n\\n  // True if the corresonding row is currently selected\\n  selected: boolean;\\n\\n  // Call this if you want to change the selection\\n  setSelected(selected: boolean): void;\\n\\n  selectedIds: string[];\\n  canSelect: boolean;\\n  toggle(): void;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n::: tip\\n`fd-table` is pretty fast. However it currently renders everything no matter whether an item is currently displayed or not. The `items`-array should be somewhere around `0` and `5.000`. Otherwise `fd-table` will crash your browser. We are working on removing that limitation. In the meantime you should work around that by using some kind of paging mechanism.\\n:::\\n\\n## Default Table\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"default\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Table without Border\\nYou can use `borderless` on `fd-table` in order to disable the outer table border.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"no-border\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Table with Stripes\\n\\nYou can use `striped` on `fd-table` in order enable alternating colored rows.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"stripes\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Example: Adding Entries & Sorting\\n\\nThe example below is a little bit more complex. It highlights three aspects:\\n\\n### Sortable Columns\\n\\nA header can be made sortable by simply flagging it as such using `sortable` and setting `sortBy` to any sortable property of the objects in your `items`-array. By doing so `fd-table` displays sort indicators in the individual column headers. The currently applied sorting can be adjusted by simply clicking on the column headers.\\n\\n### Custom Cell Content\\nUp until now `fd-tableCell` was only used to display plain text. However, `fd-tableCell` is simply rendering whatever you put in it. This can be anything from emojis (we all like emojis, right? 😀 🥰 ) to images and even custom components.\\n\\n```html\\n// …\\n<fd-table-cell>{{item.rating}}</fd-table-cell>\\n// …\\n<fd-table-cell>{{item.firstName}} {{item.lastName}}</fd-table-cell>\\n// …\\n```\\n\\nThe two lines above show that in action. The first cell is simply rendering the rating which is just a string with emojis. The second line is combining the first name with the last name in order to render the full name. But as already said: You can put in whatever you want.\\n\\n### Modifying the displayed Items\\n`fd-table` watches for any changes to it's items array. So you can simply add/remove and modify anything you want.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nIf you modify the `items`-array, make sure that the modification is done in a way compatible with [Vue's reactivity system](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"complex\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Table with fixed Column\\nUse `<fd-table-fixed-wrapper>` on and `fd-table-fixed` in order to make the first column stay fixed when scrolling.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nUsing fixed columns is still experimental.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"fixed-col\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Selection Modes\\n\\n`fd-table` supports three different selection modes:\\n\\n1. Selection mode `none` (default): Rows are not selectable in any way.\\n2. Selection mode `single`: There can only ever be a single selected row.\\n3. Selection mode `multiple`: Multiple rows can be selected.\\n\\nUse the `selectionMode`-prop to set the selection mode of your choice.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"selection-modes\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Performance Test\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\n`fd-table` is not yet capable of displaying huge data sets. The current limit is around `1.000`-`5.000` rows (depending on the browser, number of elements currently present in the DOM, number of columns, displayed data, …).\\n\\n**If you want to display a lot of data consider using** `fd-virtualized-list`.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"performance-test\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Custom Row Content\\n\\nYou can put other components (for example a simple `fd-button`) in `fd-table-cell`.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nIf a component you put inside an `fd-tableCell` subscribes to `@click`-events, you will most likely wand to use the `.stop`-modifier. Otherwise clicking a button will toggle the selection of the enclosing row.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"with-components\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Dynamic Columns\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"dynamic-columns\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Select by Clicking on Row\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"select-by-row-click\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\"","export default \"<template>\\n  <div>\\n    <fd-calendar />\\n  </div>\\n</template>\\n\"","export default \"<template>\\n  <div>\\n    <p>\\n      Predicate:\\n      <code>{{ predicate }}</code>\\n    </p>\\n    <fd-search-input v-model=\\\"predicate\\\" placeholder=\\\"Search\\\" />\\n  </div>\\n</template>\\n\\n<script>\\nexport default {\\n  data: () => ({ predicate: \\\"Apples and Oranges\\\" })\\n};\\n</script>\\n\"","export default {\"componentDesc\":{\"default\":[]},\"name\":\"fd-shell-footer\",\"props\":[{\"name\":\"fixed\",\"type\":\"Boolean\",\"describe\":[],\"default\":\"false\"}],\"slots\":[{\"name\":\"default\",\"describe\":\"\",\"backerDesc\":\"\",\"bindings\":{},\"scoped\":false,\"target\":\"template\"}]};","export default \"---\\nfdRelatedComponents:\\n  - fd-side-nav\\n  - fd-side-nav-list\\n  - fd-side-nav-item\\n  - fd-side-nav-link\\n  - fd-side-nav-group\\n  - fd-side-nav-group-title\\n  - fd-side-nav-sub-list\\n  - fd-side-nav-sub-item\\n  - fd-side-nav-sub-link\\n  - fd-side-nav-icon\\n---\\n\\n# Side Navigation\\n\\n## Dynamic Side Navigation\\n\\n`fd-side-nav-list` requires  which you set via the `items`-prop. You can put anything into your items. However there are a few special attributes you should be aware of:\\n\\n```typescript\\ntype Item = {\\n  // A SideNav-wide unique id\\n  id?: string; // default: random string\\n\\n  // Child items – if this is non-empty the\\n  // item becomes expandable.\\n  children: Item[] = [];\\n}\\n```\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"dynamic\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Working with the current Selection\\n\\nThe prop `selectedId` supports the `.sync`-modifier.

fd-calendar\\n---\\n\\n# Calendar\\n\\nThe `fd-calendar` component is usually displayed inside an `fd-popover`. Scroll down to see an example if you are unsure how to do that. Even though the calendar is a very complex component getting started is as easy as pie. This\\n\\n```html\\n<fd-calendar />\\n```\\n\\ngets you the default calendar displayed below. `fd-calendar` has a lot of customization points. Please refer to the examples below for details.\\n\\n## Default Calendar\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\n`fd-calendar` is still under heavy development. Things might break.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"default\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar Rangle Selection\\n\\nBy default you can only select a single date. To change that simply set the `selectionMode` to 'range'.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"selection-range\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar with blocked Items\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"blocked-items\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar with Disabled Items\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"disabled-items\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar & `v-model`\\n\\n`fd-calendar` supports `v-model`. The example below shows two calendars bound to the same model.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"bindings\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar in a Popover\\n\\nCalendars work best when displayed in a popover. You can use `fd-popover` for that.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"popover\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar with custom Names\\n\\n::: tip\\nYou can customize the names (day of week and month of year)  displayed in the calendar by using the props `dayNames` and `monthNames`. This is also how you would implement i18n.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"custom-names\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Controlling Calendar Buttons\\nThe `hasNext` and `hasPrevious` props can be used to control the next and previous buttons in the calendar header. Those props are functions that return either `true` or `false`. Returning `false` disables the corresponding button. The calendar passes an object containing the `min` and `max` date of the currently displayed month.\\n\\n::: tip\\nThe example below let's you go three month into the future and past by using the previous and next buttons in the header. By using the year and month picker the user can still go to months/years that are not reachable with previous and next buttons.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"buttons\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Controlling the First Day of Week\\n\\nBy default the first day of the week is **Sunday**. You can customize that by using the `first-day-of-week`-prop. `first-day-of-week` accepts a number between `0` (default) and `6`. By setting `first-day-of-week` to `1` you basically set the first day of the week to **Monday**.\\n\\n::: tip\\nIf you customize weekday names by using the `day-names`-prop you do that independently from `first-day-of-week`. This means that even though you may have set a different `first-day-of-week`, the first name specified in `day-names` is always and will always be the name for **Sunday**.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"first-day-of-week\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Default Date\\n\\nBy default the calendar displays the current month. You can change that by setting  `default-value` to a custom date value.\\n\\n\\n::: tip\\n`default-value` accepts values of type `Number`, `String` and `Date`. The `Number` or `String` you pass to `default-value` simply be forwarded to the `Date`'s constructor.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"default-date\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Calendar without the Header\\n\\nYou can hide the header by setting `header-visible` to `false`. Without a header it is hard to tell which date is displayed/selected. Thus it is a good idea to render the currently displayed/selected date separately.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"no-header\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var

The `prepend` slot allows you to control what should be rendered before a node's label. In the `label` slot you can really pass any element that you like depending on your use case.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"file-explorer\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n\\n## Props\\n\\nBy default,the tree will look for a `name` property to use it as node label and a `children` property to extract a node's children. However if you already have objects with tree-like structure, you don't need to transform them into an array of objects following the default naming. You can use the props to specify the path to the `name` and `children` properties. You can even use nested property names, just like in the example below, in the format of `'nestedPropertyName.deepProperty'`.

Offscreen data is not rendered. Thus scrolling through your list should be very efficient. `fd-virtualized-list` depends on a 3rd-party (open source) library called [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller). *Fundamental Vue* does not include a copy of [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller). It is up to you to properly setup [vue-virtual-scroller](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-virtual-scroller).\\n\\nYour `items`-array must have some kind of unique identifier. Use the `key-field`-prop to specify the name of the property.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nYou also have to install [vue-observe-visibility](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-observe-visibility) because `fd-virtualized-list` requires the `v-observe-visibility`-directive.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n## Simple Virtualized List\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-default\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Lazy Loading Virtualized List\\n\\n\\nYou don't have to tell `fd-virtualized-list` all of your items in advance. You can simply give `fd-virtualized-list` only a few items, just enough to fill it up completely. Once the user has scrolled to the bottom of the list you are asked to provide more items.\\n\\nThis works by passing an item loader by using the `load-more-items`-prop. Typically this prop is simply a method in your component.\\n\\nThis method will automatically be alled by `fd-virtualized-list` once more items are required in order to let the user continue to scroll.\\n\\nYour method that loads more items is invoked with a callback that has to be called. A typical method that loads more items and can be used in conjunction with `load-more-items` may look like this:\\n\\n```js\\n{\\n  data() {\\n    return { items: [/* your items */]}\\n  },\\n  methods: {\\n    loadMoreItems(done) {\\n      // Load more items…\\n      const newItems = this.fetchItemsFromBackend();\\n      // Add the new items to your items-array:\\n      this.items.push(...newItems);\\n      // Call done.\\n      done()\\n    }\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nBetween `loadMoreItems` is invoked and you calling `done` `fd-virtualized-list` is in a loading state and displays a spinner (`fd-spinner`) at the very bottom. This can be customized by specifying a custom `loading`-slot.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nThe example below loads new items for ever and ever. You will never reach the end. Sorry.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-loading-more\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Initial Load\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-initial-load\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Resetting a Virtualized List\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-reset\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Filtering a Virtualized List\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-filter\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Adding/Removing Items from a Virtualized List\\n\\nYou can modify the `items`-array directly in order to add/remove items. The rules as described in the [Vue Reactivity Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html) still apply.\\n\\nIf you click on `[Add Item]` a new item will be appened to the beginning of the `items`-array.\\nIf an item is selected, clicking on `[Add Item]` will insert an item right below the current selection.\\nClicking on `[Remove Item]` will remove the currently selected item from the list.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"virtualized-list-mutate\\\">\\n</d-example>\"","export default \"---\\nfdRelatedComponents:\\n  - fd-date-input\\n---\\n\\n# Date Input\\n\\n`fd-date-input` can be used to get date + date range inputs from a user.

In this case, you do not need the CDN link as this method uses the SASS/SCSS source.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">To install the Fiori Fundamentals SASS/SCSS source:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-sh\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> --save fiori-fundamentals\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">The following assumes the usage of a module bundler such as <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/\">webpack</a>. To compile Fiori Fundamentals SASS/SCSS to CSS, two additional packages are required for your bundling process - <a href=\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader\">sass-loader</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\">node-sass</a>. To install these packages as development dependencies:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-sh\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">npm</span> <span class=\"token function\">install</span> sass-loader node-sass --save-dev\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Loading the SCSS and running your project at this point will result in errors relating to the path configuration for icons and fonts. This is a <a href=\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental#known-issues\">known issue</a>.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">To rectify this, start by creating a new directory (‘scss’) in your project’s <code>src</code>. Within this directory, create a main SCSS file (‘main.scss’) from which to manage your imports, configurations and customisations.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Add the following to the main SCSS file:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-scss\"><code><span class=\"token comment\">// If you are targeting IE 11 uncomment the following line.</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// $fd-support-css-var-fallback: true;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// should be declared before the scss import</span>\n<span class=\"token property\"><span class=\"token variable\">$fd-icons-path</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/icons/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token property\"><span class=\"token variable\">$fd-scss-font-path</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/fonts/\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">@import</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/all.scss\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Import the main SCSS file in your <code>App.js</code> style block to add Fiori Fundamentals styles to your project.</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-scss\"><code>&lt;style lang=<span class=\"token string\">'scss'</span>>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">@import</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"./scss/main.scss\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token comment\">// …</span>\n&lt;/style>\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">You can now use the <a href=\"https://sap.github.io/fundamental-vue/\">Documentation</a> to browse the components currently available with Fundamental Vue.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">To use a Fundamental Vue component, paste the desired code snippet from the Playground and configure it as necessary:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-xml\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>fd-alert</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">dismissible</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n    Happy building! 🚀\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>fd-alert</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Versioning</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">The <code>fundamental-vue</code> library follows <a href=\"https://semver.org/\">Semantic Versioning</a>.

Create a folder that contains all of your files. For example:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> ui/src/components/Flower\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> ui/src/components/Flower/index.ts\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> ui/src/components/Flower/Flower.vue\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> ui/src/components/Flower/Blossom.vue\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> ui/src/components/Flower/Util.ts\n</code></pre>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Implementing the Component</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>ui/src/components/Flower/Flower.vue</strong></p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-xml\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>div</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">:style</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>style<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>I am a flower<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>div</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>script</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">lang</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>ts<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\nimport Vue from \"vue\";\n\nexport default Vue.extend({\n  name: \"FdFlower\",\n  props: {\n    color: String\n  },\n  computed: {\n    styles() {\n      return {\n        backgroundColor: this.color\n      };\n    }\n  }\n});\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>script</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Exporting the new Component</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">You have to export the new component:</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>ui/src/components/Flower/index.ts</strong></p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-typescript\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> Flower <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"./Flower.vue\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> pluginify <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"@/util\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">default</span> <span class=\"token function\">pluginify</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>Flower<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">export</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> Flower <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Documenting the new Component</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">In order to make your component available to the public you have to document the component. A properly documented component consists of at least two things:</p>\n<ul class=\"fdd-md--ul\">\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\">Examples</li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\">API Documentation</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Documenting the new Component: Examples</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">In order to create a example for your new component create the necessary files:</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-bash\"><code>$ <span class=\"token function\">mkdir</span> docs/src/pages/Flower\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> docs/src/pages/Flower/0-default.vue\n$ <span class=\"token function\">touch</span> docs/src/pages/Flower/index.ts\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Examples are implemented as single file components (in our case <code>docs/src/pages/Flower/0-default.vue</code>) because this is what most Vue developers are using. You can put anything you want in the vue-file: a <code>&lt;template&gt;</code>-block, a <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>-block and a <code>&lt;style&gt;</code>-block.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Fundamental Vue examples may contain additional documentation specific blocks.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>_baseline.json:</strong>\ndocs/src/api/_baseline.json</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Here you add the documentation that needs to be added for your component; like the possible slots, props, events, mixins etc.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>pages.json:</strong>\ndocs/src/pages/pages.json</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Here you add the page configuration in which the documentation will be shown; like the title that comes on the left section, the files that need to be read and stuff.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Lets simply implement the most basic example possible:</p>\n<h3 class=\"fdd-md--h3\">Simple Example</h3>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>docs/src/pages/Flower/0-default.vue</strong></p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-xml\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n  <span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>FdFlower</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">color</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>red<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/></span></span>\n<span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;/</span>template</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">></span></span>\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">You can include a <code>script</code> and/or <code>style</code> section if needed. If you declare custom styles make sure to make your <code>style</code>-section scoped.</p>\n<h3 class=\"fdd-md--h3\">Improved Example</h3>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">As already mentioned in the paragraph above, you can improve your example by using addional blocks. Namely:</p>\n<ul class=\"fdd-md--ul\">\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><code>&lt;title&gt;Example Title&lt;/title&gt;</code>: Specify a title for your example. The title is displayed in a big font above your example.</li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><code>&lt;docs&gt;Potentially long example description&lt;/docs&gt;</code>: Describe the example in detail. This is displayed directly below the title. <strong>Supports Markdown</strong></li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\"><code>&lt;tip&gt;Short but useful tip related to the example/component.&lt;/tip&gt;</code> If there is something important, especially useful or good to know fact use the <code>&lt;tip&gt;</code>-block. This is displayed in a highlighted box below the <code>&lt;docs&gt;</code>-block. <strong>Supports Markdown</strong></li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><strong>docs/src/pages/Flower/0-default.vue</strong></p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-xml\"><code><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token

either be localized or localizable.</p>\n<ul class=\"fdd-md--ul\">\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\">A <strong>localizable component</strong> may display non-localized text/icons but the displayed text should be configurable by the application developer.</li>\n<li class=\"fdd-md--li\">A <strong>localized component</strong> is fully localized out of the box.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Since there is no Fundamental Vue-wide localisation and internationalization concept (localized icons, right-to-left-support, …) you should at least create an issue for the component you implemented.</p>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Accessibility</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Having an accessible component directly means catering to a broader audience than otherwise.\nIt needs to be noted that each new component is expected to be accessible.</p>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">For details, please refer to: <a

Things might break.</p>\n</div></div><d-example name=\"default\">\n</d-example>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Calendar Rangle Selection</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">By default you can only select a single date. To change that simply set the <code>selectionMode</code> to ‘range’.</p>\n<d-example name=\"selection-range\">\n</d-example>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Calendar with blocked Items</h2>\n<d-example name=\"blocked-items\">\n</d-example>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Calendar with Disabled Items</h2>\n<d-example name=\"disabled-items\">\n</d-example>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Calendar &amp; <code>v-model</code></h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\"><d-component-api-link type=\"prominent\" component-name=\"fd-calendar\"></d-component-api-link> supports <code>v-model</code>.

You can customize that by using the <code>first-day-of-week</code>-prop. <code>first-day-of-week</code> accepts a number between <code>0</code> (default) and <code>6</code>. By setting <code>first-day-of-week</code> to <code>1</code> you basically set the first day of the week to <strong>Monday</strong>.</p>\n<div class=\"fdd-tip\"><div class=\"fdd-tip__body\"><p class=\"fdd-md--p\">If you customize weekday names by using the <code>day-names</code>-prop you do that independently from <code>first-day-of-week</code>. This means that even though you may have set a different <code>first-day-of-week</code>, the first name specified in <code>day-names</code> is always and will always be the name for <strong>Sunday</strong>.</p>\n</div></div><d-example name=\"first-day-of-week\">\n</d-example>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Default Date</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">By default the calendar displays the current month.

You can use <code>v-model</code> on <code>fd-buttonGroupButton</code>. The <code>value</code> of a button group is always an array which contains the <code>value</code> of each pressed/selected <code>fd-buttonGroupButton</code>.

Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.</p>\n<pre v-pre class=\"language-javascript\"><code><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> <span class=\"token function-variable function\">mySelectionMode</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token parameter\">selection<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> value</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>value <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"foo\"</span> <span class=\"token operator\">||</span> value <span class=\"token operator\">===</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"bar\"</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> selection<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> index <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> selection<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">indexOf</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>value<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> newSelection <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token operator\">...</span>selection<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">if</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>index <span class=\"token operator\">>=</span> <span class=\"token number\">0</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    <span class=\"token comment\">// value is already selected, remove it</span>\n    newSelection<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">splice</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>index<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> newSelection<span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n  <span class=\"token comment\">// value is not selected, add it</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">return</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>value<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token operator\">...</span>newSelection<span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n</code></pre>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">The custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code>.

The data that is passed as an <code>items</code> array, is nested. Meaning that a node can have multiple child node. If that’s the case, then it will be expandable.</p>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Simple Tree</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">The most simple usage of the tree is passing it an array where each object has a <code>name</code> and <code>children</code> property.</p>\n<d-example name=\"default\">\n</d-example>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Slots</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">Using the <code>prepend</code> and <code>label</code> slots, with the same data from the example above, we can customize our tree to look like an actual file explorer. The <code>prepend</code> slot allows you to control what should be rendered before a node’s label. In the <code>label</code> slot you can really pass any element that you like depending on your use case.</p>\n<d-example name=\"file-explorer\">\n</d-example>\n<h2 class=\"fdd-md--h2\">Props</h2>\n<p class=\"fdd-md--p\">By default,the tree will look for a <code>name</code> property to use it as node label and a <code>children</code> property to extract a node’s children. However if you already have objects with tree-like structure, you don’t need to transform them into an array of objects following the default naming. You can use the props to specify the path to the <code>name</code> and <code>children</code> properties. You can even use nested property names, just like in the example below, in the format of <code>'nestedPropertyName.deepProperty'</code>.

You should show a popover/menu in when this event is emitted.\\n\\n::: tip\\n`fd-split-button` does not display a menu or popover when clicked. It is up to you to set that up.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"split-button-playground\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Split Button With Menu\\n\\n`fd-split-button` works perfectly together with `fd-menu-popover`.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"split-button-popover\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Button States\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"states\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Button Groups\\n\\nUse an `fd-buttonGroup` in order to group buttons. `fd-buttonGroupButton` supports everything (ex. `icon`, `@click(…), …`) a regular `fd-button` does. You can use `v-model` on `fd-buttonGroupButton`. The `value` of a button group is always an array which contains the `value` of each pressed/selected `fd-buttonGroupButton`. You associate a value with a button group button by using it's `value`-prop. There are also three selection modes (specified by using the `selectionMode`-prop on the group):\\n\\n1. `single`: A single button can be pressed/selected at a time.\\n2. `multiple`: Multiple buttons can be pressed/selected at a time.\\n3. **A custom selection mode function**\\n\\n**Custom Selection Mode**\\n\\nIf you have special needs you can specific a custom selection mode function. Simply pass a function to the `selectionMode`-prop. The function will be called with the current selection and the value of button that has just been clicked/tapped. Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.\\n\\n```javascript\\nconst mySelectionMode = (selection, value) => {\\n  if(value === \\\"foo\\\" || value === \\\"bar\\\") {\\n    return selection;\\n  }\\n  const index = selection.indexOf(value);\\n  const newSelection = [...selection];\\n  if(index >= 0) {\\n    // value is already selected, remove it\\n    newSelection.splice(index);\\n    return newSelection;\\n  }\\n  // value is not selected, add it\\n  return [value, ...newSelection];\\n};\\n```\\n\\nThe custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value `foo` or `bar`. Otherwise it acts just like the multiple selection mode.\\n\\n::: tip\\nA button group may only contain `fd-button-group-button`-instances. If you use `fd-button` instead, things will not work correctly.\\n\\n**Important**\\n\\nMake sure to set `aria-label` on the button group.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"groups\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n\\n## Compact Button Groups\\n\\n::: tip\\nThe compact size is only used on desktop and it is full size when used on a touch device.\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"groups-compact\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('fd-tile-grid',{attrs:{\"col\":5}},[_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1),_c('fd-tile',[_c('fd-tile-content',[_c('fd-tile-title',[_vm._v(\"Lorem ipsum\")])],1)],1)],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./tile-grid--col-5-with-tile.vue?vue&type=template&id=2e304e44&\"\nvar script = {}\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('fd-menu',{attrs:{\"canHaveAddon\":\"\"}},[_c('fd-menu-list',[_c('fd-menu-item',[_vm._v(\"Option 1\")]),_c('fd-menu-item',[_c('span',{staticClass:\"sap-icon--accept\",attrs:{\"slot\":\"addon\"},slot:\"addon\"}),_vm._v(\" Option 2 \")]),_c('fd-menu-item',[_vm._v(\"Option 3\")]),_c('fd-menu-item',[_vm._v(\"Option 4\")])],1)],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./menu-addon.vue?vue&type=template&id=475ce612&\"\nvar script = {}\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _vm._m(0)}\nvar staticRenderFns = [function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',[_c('h1',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h1\"},[_vm._v(\"fd-side-nav-link\")]),_c('h2',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h2\"},[_vm._v(\"Props\")]),_c('h3',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h3\"},[_vm._v(\"asRouterLink\")]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--p\"},[_c('strong',[_vm._v(\"Type:\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('code',[_vm._v(\"Boolean\")])]),_c('p',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--p\"},[_c('strong',[_vm._v(\"Default:\")]),_vm._v(\" \"),_c('code',[_vm._v(\"false\")])]),_c('h2',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h2\"},[_vm._v(\"Slots\")]),_c('h3',{staticClass:\"fdd-md--h3\"},[_vm._v(\"default\")])])}]\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-plugin-babel/node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/@vue/cli-service/node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!../../../loaders/fd-component-api-loader.js!./SideNavLink.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&fddApi\";

A menu contains one or more `fd-menu-list`s. Lists in turn contain `fd-menu-item`s. *This separation allows you to put similar items in the same group and bring order to chaos*. Further down you will find examples that show how to use multiple lists.\\n\\n**Events**\\n\\n- `fd-menu-item` emits `click` when clicked.\\n- Both, `fd-menu-list` and `fd-menu` emit `select`-events every time an item was clicked. The payload is the item itself. They act as some kind of event aggregator which is useful if you don't care about the context of the clicked items so much.\\n\\n## Default Menu\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Menu Item with Link\\n\\n\\n**`fd-menu-item` is smart:**\\n\\n`fd-menu-item` looks at what you put in it. If you have an item with just text, `fd-menu-item` will detect that and automatically wrap it with an anchor-element. So this:\\n\\n```html\\n<fd-menu-item>click me</fd-menu-item>\\n```\\n\\nwill yield the same *HTML* as\\n\\n```html\\n<fd-menu-item>\\n  <fd-menu-link>click me</fd-menu-link>\\n</fd-menu-item>\\n```\\n\\nIf you put anything other than just plain text inside `fd-menu-item` then this automatism won't kick in.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\n`fd-menuLink` is just a simple wrapper around the standard `a`-element. This allows you to further customize the menu item (`href`, `target`, …).\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menuitem-link\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Menu w/ Group\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu-group\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Menu w/ addon before\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu-addon\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Menu w/ separated items\\n\\nUse the `separated` modifier on `fd-menu-list` to add separators between the items.\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu-separated\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\\n## Menu Highlight\\n\\n`fd-menu` currently has a limited API to control the highlighting-state. At this moment only two methods are exposed:\\n\\n1. `highlightNextItem()`: Highlights the next menu item.\\n2. `highlightPreviousItem()`: Highlights the previous menu item.\\n\\nYou should rarely need to manually call those methods. They are mainly used to support keyboard navigation.\\n\\n::: tip\\n\\nBy setting `highlights-selection` to `true` you tell `fd-menu` that selected items should be highlighted. A highlighted menu item is rendered with a background colored in light-blue.\\n\\n:::\\n\\n<d-example name=\\\"menu-selection\\\">\\n</d-example>\\n\"","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var
