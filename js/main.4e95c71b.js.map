You can use `v-model` on `FdButtonGroupButton`. The `value` of a button group is always an array which contains the `value` of each pressed/selected `FdButtonGroupButton`. You associate a value with a button group button by using it's `value`-prop. There are also three selection modes (specified by using the `selectionMode`-prop on the group):\n\n1. `single`: A single button can be pressed/selected at a time.\n2. `multiple`: Multiple buttons can be pressed/selected at a time.\n3. **A custom selection mode function**\n\n**Custom Selection Mode**\n\nIf you have special needs you can specific a custom selection mode function. Simply pass a function to the `selectionMode`-prop. The function will be called with the current selection and the value of button that has just been clicked/tapped. Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.\n\n```javascript\nconst mySelectionMode = (selection, value) => {\n  if(value === \"foo\" || value === \"bar\") {\n    return selection;\n  }\n  const index = selection.indexOf(value);\n  const newSelection = [...selection];\n  if(index >= 0) {\n    // value is already selected, remove it\n    newSelection.splice(index);\n    return newSelection;\n  }\n  // value is not selected, add it\n  return [value, ...newSelection];\n};\n```\n\nThe custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value `foo` or `bar`. Otherwise it acts just like the multiple selection mode.\n</docs>\n<tip>A button group may only contain `FdButtonGroupButton`s.

Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">const mySelectionMode = (selection, <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span>) =&gt; {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> === <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"foo\\\"</span> || <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> === <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"bar\\\"</span>) {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> selection;\\n  }\\n  const index = selection.indexOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span>);\\n  const newSelection = [...selection];\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(index &gt;= <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>) {\\n    // <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">is</span> already selected,<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\"> remove</span> it\\n    newSelection.splice(index);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> newSelection;\\n  }\\n  // <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">is</span><span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\"> not</span> selected, add it\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> [<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span>, ...newSelection];\\n};</code></pre>\\n<p>The custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code>.

and <a href=\\\"https://vuejs.org\\\">Vue.js</a>.</p>\\n</blockquote>\\n<h2 id=\\\"installation\\\">Installation</h2>\\n<p>You can install Fundamental Vue via <strong>NPM</strong> or by simply including it by using the <code>&lt;script&gt;</code>- and <code>&lt;link&gt;</code>-tags.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"installation-via-script-and-link\\\">Installation via <strong>&lt;script&gt;</strong> and <strong>&lt;link&gt;</strong></h3>\\n<p>In order to use Fundamental Vue you have to include three things in your <code>index.html</code> file:</p>\\n<ol>\\n<li>Fundamental CSS styles</li>\\n<li>Vue</li>\\n<li>Fundamental Vue</li>\\n</ol>\\n<p>Paste the following snippet in your <code>&lt;head&gt;</code>-tag:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-html\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">link</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">rel</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"stylesheet\\\"</span> <span

class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">script</span>&gt;</span></code></pre>\\n<p>Then you can use Fundamental Vue like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-xhtml\\\"><span class=\\\"xml\\\"><span

<em>Hello Fundamental Vue!</em>. Clicking on it will display a popover.</p>\\n<h3 id=\\\"install-fundamental-vue-via-npm\\\">Install Fundamental Vue via <strong>NPM</strong>:</h3>\\n<p>Fundamental Vue can also be installed via NPM which requires a few more steps but is also a bit more flexible.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-bash\\\">npm <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">install</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">--save fundamental-vue</span></code></pre>\\n<h2 id=\\\"usage\\\">Usage</h2>\\n<p>After installing, you will need to import <code>fundamental-vue</code> and make it available to your Vue application. These instructions assume the usage of Vue CLI to scaffold your project.</p>\\n<p>In your project&#39;s <code>main.js</code>:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// ...</span>\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">import</span> FundamentalVue <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">from</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">'fundamental-vue'</span>;\\nVue.use(FundamentalVue);\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// ...</span></code></pre><p>Fundamental Vue does not include the <a href=\\\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental\\\">&#39;Fiori Fundamentals&#39; library</a> which is required for styling.</p>\\n<h2 id=\\\"install-fiori-fundamentals\\\">Install Fiori Fundamentals</h2>\\n<p>The quickest way to get Fiori Fundamentals styling for your components is  to include the compiled and minified Fiori Fundamentals CSS library with the following CDN link in your public <code>index.html</code> file:</p>\\n<pre><code>&lt;link <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">rel</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"stylesheet\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">type</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"text/css\\\"</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attribute\\\">href</span>=<span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"https://unpkg.com/fiori-fundamentals@1.4.3/dist/fiori-fundamentals.min.css\\\"</span>&gt;</code></pre><p>However, installing the Fiori Fundamentals library with npm (recommended) will give you the flexibility to use individual components and enable <a href=\\\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental/wiki/Advanced-Customization\\\">advanced customisation options</a>. In this case, you do not need the CDN link as this method uses the SASS/SCSS source.</p>\\n<p>To install the Fiori Fundamentals SASS/SCSS source:</p>\\n<pre><code>$ npm <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">install</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">--save fiori-fundamentals</span></code></pre><p>The following assumes the usage of a module bundler such as <a href=\\\"https://webpack.js.org/\\\">webpack</a>. To compile Fiori Fundamentals SASS/SCSS to CSS, two additional packages are required for your bundling process - <a href=\\\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader\\\">sass-loader</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\\\">node-sass</a>. To install these packages as development dependencies:</p>\\n<pre><code>$ npm install sass-loader <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">node</span><span class=\\\"hljs-title\\\">-sass</span> --save-dev</code></pre><p>Loading the SCSS and running your project at this point will result in errors relating to the path configuration for icons and fonts. This is a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental#known-issues\\\">known issue</a>.</p>\\n<p>To rectify this, start by creating a new directory (&#39;scss&#39;) in your project&#39;s <code>src</code>. Within this directory, create a main SCSS file (&#39;main.scss&#39;) from which to manage your imports, configurations and customisations.</p>\\n<p>Add the following to the main SCSS file:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-variable\\\">$fd-icons-path</span> : <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/icons/\\\"</span>; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// should be declared before the scss import</span>\\n\\n<span class=\\\"hljs-variable\\\">$fd-scss-font-path</span> : <span

class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"../node_modules/fiori-fundamentals/scss/all.scss\\\"</span>;</code></pre><p>Import the main SCSS file in your <code>App.js</code> style block to add Fiori Fundamentals styles to your project.</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-tag\\\">&lt;<span class=\\\"hljs-name\\\">style</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-attr\\\">lang</span>=<span

By doing so `FdTable` displays sort indicators in the individual column headers. The currently applied sorting can be adjusted by simply clicking on the column headers.\n\n### Custom Cell Content\nUp until now `FdTableCell` was only used to display plain text. However, `FdTableCell` is simply rendering whatever you put in it. This can be anything from emojis (we all like emojis, right? 😀 🥰 ) to images and even custom components.\n\n```html\n// …\n<FdTableCell>{{item.rating}}</FdTableCell>\n// …\n<FdTableCell>{{item.firstName}} {{item.lastName}}</FdTableCell>\n// …\n```\n\nThe two lines above show that in action. The first cell is simply rendering the rating which is just a string with emojis. The second line is combining the first name with the last name in order to render the full name. But as already said: You can put in whatever you want.\n\n### Modifying the displayed Items\n`FdTable` watches for any changes to it's items array. So you can simply add/remove and modify anything you want.\n</docs>\n\n<tip>\nIf you modify the `items`-array, make sure that the modification is done in a way compatible with [Vue's reactivity system](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html).\n</tip>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <FdTable :headers=\"headers\" :items=\"items\">\n      <template slot=\"row\" slot-scope=\"{ item }\">\n        <FdTableRow>\n          <FdTableCell>{{ item.rating }}</FdTableCell>\n          <FdTableCell>{{ item.firstName }}</FdTableCell>\n          <FdTableCell>{{ item.lastName }}</FdTableCell>\n          <FdTableCell>{{ item.firstName }} {{ item.lastName }}</FdTableCell>\n        </FdTableRow>\n      </template>\n    </FdTable>\n\n    <h2>Creating an Entry</h2>\n\n    <FdFormSet>\n      <FdFormItem label=\"First Name\">\n        <FdInput\n          v-model=\"newEntry.firstName\"\n          placeholder=\"Enter something nice\"\n        />\n      </FdFormItem>\n      <FdFormItem label=\"Last Name\">\n        <FdInput\n          v-model=\"newEntry.lastName\"\n          placeholder=\"Enter something nice\"\n        />\n      </FdFormItem>\n      <FdFormItem label=\"Rating\">\n        <FdCombobox v-model=\"newEntry.rating\">\n          <FdMenuItem value=\"️️️⭐️\">⭐️</FdMenuItem>\n          <FdMenuItem value=\"⭐️⭐️\">⭐️⭐️</FdMenuItem>\n          <FdMenuItem value=\"⭐️⭐️⭐️\">⭐️⭐️⭐️</FdMenuItem>\n          <FdMenuItem value=\"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</FdMenuItem>\n          <FdMenuItem value=\"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</FdMenuItem>\n        </FdCombobox>\n      </FdFormItem>\n    </FdFormSet>\n    <FdButton @click=\"addCurrentEntry\">Add Entry</FdButton>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    addCurrentEntry() {\n      const entry = {\n        ...this.newEntry\n      };\n      this.items = [...this.items, entry];\n      this.newEntry = {\n        firstName: null,\n        lastName: null,\n        rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n        id: String(this.items.length + 1)\n      };\n    }\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      headers: [\n        { label: \"Rating\", sortable: true, sortBy: \"rating\" },\n        { label: \"First Name\", sortable: true, sortBy: \"firstName\" },\n        { label: \"Last Name\", sortable: true, sortBy: \"lastName\" },\n        { label: \"Full Name\", sortable: true, sortBy: \"firstName\" }\n      ],\n      newEntry: {\n        firstName: null,\n        lastName: null,\n        rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n        id: \"5\"\n      },\n      items: [\n        {\n          id: \"1\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Chris\",\n          lastName: \"Kienle\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"2\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Andi\",\n          lastName: \"Kienle\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"3\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Sven\",\n          lastName: \"Bacia\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"4\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Artur\",\n          lastName: \"Raess\"\n        }\n      ]\n    };\n  }\n};\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./3-complex.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./3-complex.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__title = \"Example: Adding Entries & Sorting\"\n}","import mod from \"-!../../../loaders/block-loader.js?optionName=__title!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./3-complex.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../loaders/block-loader.js?optionName=__title!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./3-complex.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__docs = \"<p>The example below is a little bit more complex.

If `FdTable` encounters an item without an `id`-property, an `id` will be created. The `id` of an item is used to uniquely identify the corresponding item. Each item may contain any additional custom properties.\n\n### FdTable Atonomy\n\n#### The Table Header: `FdTableHeader`\nIt is the responsibility of `FdTable` to render it's header. The header renders column names, sort indicators and custom content. You configure the header of an `FdTable` by using it's `headers`-prop. The `headers`-prop accepts an array which may contain strings or header configuration objects. A plain string inside the `headers`-array will be used as a label for the column header. The complete definition of the `headers`-prop looks like this:\n\n```typescript\ntype Header = {\n  label: string;\n  sortable?: boolean;\n  sortBy?: string;\n  alignment?: TextAlignment; // 'center' or 'default'\n  renderHeader?: HeaderCellRenderFunction; // not yet implemented\n} | string;\n```\n\n#### The Table Row Template: `FdTableRow`\nRows are rendered by `FdTable` on your behalf. This is why you don't specify each row individually. Instead you describe how to render a row (`FdTableRow`) given some context (using Vue's __slot-scope__-mechanism). The object passed to the template has the following shape:\n\n```typescript\n// Object passed to the row template.\ninterface RowSlotProps<T=object> {\n  // Your custom item\n  item: T & { id: string; };\n\n  // True if the corresonding row is currently selected\n  selected: boolean;\n\n  // Call this if you want to change the selection\n  // Of the current row. Typically bound to an\n  // `@change`-event from `FdCheckbox`-instances.\n  changeSelection(selected: boolean, event: Event): void;\n}\n```\n</docs>\n\n<tip>\n`FdTable` is pretty fast.

The items of a table must all be some kind of <code>Object</code>. If <code>FdTable</code> encounters an item without an <code>id</code>-property, an <code>id</code> will be created. The <code>id</code> of an item is used to uniquely identify the corresponding item.

The header renders column names, sort indicators and custom content. You configure the header of an <code>FdTable</code> by using it&#39;s <code>headers</code>-prop. The <code>headers</code>-prop accepts an array which may contain strings or header configuration objects. A plain string inside the <code>headers</code>-array will be used as a label for the column header. The complete definition of the <code>headers</code>-prop looks like this:</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-typescript\\\"><span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">type</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">Header</span> = {\\n  label: <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">string</span>;\\n  sortable?: <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">boolean</span>;\\n  sortBy?: <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">string</span>;\\n  alignment?: TextAlignment; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// 'center' or 'default'</span>\\n  renderHeader?: HeaderCellRenderFunction; <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">// not yet implemented</span>\\n} | <span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\">string</span>;</code></pre>\\n<h4 id=\\\"the-table-row-template-fdtablerow\\\">The Table Row Template: <code>FdTableRow</code></h4>\\n<p>Rows are rendered by <code>FdTable</code> on your behalf. This is why you don&#39;t specify each row individually. Instead you describe how to render a row (<code>FdTableRow</code>) given some context (using Vue&#39;s <strong>slot-scope</strong>-mechanism).
