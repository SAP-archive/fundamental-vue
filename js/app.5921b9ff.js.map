If `fd-table` encounters an item without an `id`-property, an `id` will be created. The `id` of an item is used to uniquely identify the corresponding item. Each item may contain any additional custom properties.\n\n### fd-table Atonomy\n\n#### The Table Header: `fd-tableHeader`\nIt is the responsibility of `fd-table` to render it's header. The header renders column names, sort indicators and custom content. You configure the header of an `fd-table` by using it's `headers`-prop. The `headers`-prop accepts an array which may contain strings or header configuration objects. A plain string inside the `headers`-array will be used as a label for the column header. The complete definition of the `headers`-prop looks like this:\n\n```typescript\ntype Header = {\n  label: string;\n  sortable?: boolean;\n  sortBy?: string;\n  alignment?: TextAlignment; // 'center' or 'default'\n  renderHeader?: HeaderCellRenderFunction; // not yet implemented\n} | string;\n```\n\n#### The Table Row Template: `fd-table-row`\nRows are rendered by `fd-table` on your behalf. This is why you don't specify each row individually. Instead you describe how to render a row (`fd-table-row`) given some context (using Vue's __slot-scope__-mechanism). The object passed to the template has the following shape:\n\n```typescript\n// Object passed to the row template.\ninterface RowSlotProps<T=object> {\n  // Your custom item\n  item: T & { id: string; };\n\n  // True if the corresonding row is currently selected\n  selected: boolean;\n\n  // Call this if you want to change the selection\n  setSelected(selected: boolean): void;\n\n  selectedIds: string[];\n  canSelect: boolean;\n  toggle(): void;\n}\n```\n</docs>\n\n<tip>\n`fd-table` is pretty fast. However it currently renders everything no matter whether an item is currently displayed or not. The `items`-array should be somewhere around `0` and `5.000`. Otherwise `fd-table` will crash your browser. We are working on removing that limitation. In the meantime you should work around that by using some kind of paging mechanism.\n</tip>\n\n<template>\n  <fd-table :headers=\"['firstName', 'lastName', 'building']\" :items=\"items\">\n    <template #row=\"{ item }\">\n      <fd-table-row>\n        <template #firstName>\n          <fd-table-cell>\n            {{ item.firstName }}\n          </fd-table-cell>\n        </template>\n        <template #lastName>\n          <fd-table-cell>\n            {{ item.lastName }}\n          </fd-table-cell>\n        </template>\n        <template #building>\n          <fd-table-cell>\n            {{ item.building }}\n          </fd-table-cell>\n        </template>\n      </fd-table-row>\n    </template>\n  </fd-table>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data: () => ({\n    items: [\n      { firstName: \"Chris\", lastName: \"Kienle\", building: \"WFD02\" },\n      { firstName: \"Andi\", lastName: \"Kienle\", building: \"WFD03\" },\n      { firstName: \"Sven\", lastName: \"Bacia\", building: \"WFD02\" },\n      { firstName: \"Artur\", lastName: \"Raess\", building: \"WFD02\" }\n    ]\n  })\n};\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-table-default.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-table-default.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__title = \"Table\"\n}","import mod from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--14-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-table-default.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--14-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-table-default.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__docs = \"<p>Use <code>fd-table</code> in order to display data best visualized by rows and columns.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"tip\\\" style=\\\"border-left: 0.5rem solid #ffa94a;\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"tip-title\\\">IMPORTANT</div>\\n  <div class=\\\"tip-body\\\">\\n    <p>In a previous release you didn't have to put <code>fd-table-row</code> in a <code>template</code>.

In this case, you do not need the CDN link as this method uses the SASS/SCSS source.</p>\\n<p>To install the Fundamental Styles SASS/SCSS source:</p>\\n<pre><code>$ npm <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">install</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">--save fundamental-styles</span></code></pre><p>The following assumes the usage of a module bundler such as <a href=\\\"https://webpack.js.org/\\\">webpack</a>. To compile Fundamental Styles SASS/SCSS to CSS, two additional packages are required for your bundling process - <a href=\\\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader\\\">sass-loader</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\\\">node-sass</a>.

Since <code>fd-menu-popover</code> has no custom <code>placement</code>-prop it will simply pass it to the popover.</p>\\n\"\n}","import mod from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--15-0!../../../../node_modules/markdown-loader/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./1-menu-popover-placement.vue?vue&type=custom&index=1&blockType=docs\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--15-0!../../../../node_modules/markdown-loader/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./1-menu-popover-placement.vue?vue&type=custom&index=1&blockType=docs\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./1-menu-popover-placement.vue?vue&type=template&id=0293b752&\"\nimport script from \"./1-menu-popover-placement.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./1-menu-popover-placement.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\n/* custom blocks */\nimport block0 from \"./1-menu-popover-placement.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"\nif (typeof block0 === 'function') block0(component)\nimport block1 from \"./1-menu-popover-placement.vue?vue&type=custom&index=1&blockType=docs\"\nif (typeof block1 === 'function') block1(component)\n\nexport default component.exports","var render = function () {var _vm=this;var _h=_vm.$createElement;var _c=_vm._self._c||_h;return _c('div',[_c('fd-calendar',{attrs:{\"first-day-of-week\":1}})],1)}\nvar staticRenderFns = []\n\nexport { render, staticRenderFns }","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__title = \"Controlling the First Day of Week\"\n}","import mod from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--14-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./8-first-day-of-week.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--14-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./8-first-day-of-week.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__docs = \"<p>By default the first day of the week is <strong>Sunday</strong>.

You can use `v-model` on `fd-button-group-button`. The `value` of a button group is always an array which contains the `value` of each pressed/selected `fd-button-group-button`. You associate a value with a button group button by using it's `value`-prop. There are also three selection modes (specified by using the `selectionMode`-prop on the group):\n\n1. `single`: A single button can be pressed/selected at a time.\n2. `multiple`: Multiple buttons can be pressed/selected at a time.\n3. **A custom selection mode function**\n\n**Custom Selection Mode**\n\nIf you have special needs you can specific a custom selection mode function. Simply pass a function to the `selectionMode`-prop. The function will be called with the current selection and the value of button that has just been clicked/tapped. Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.\n\n```javascript\nconst mySelectionMode = (selection, value) => {\n  if(value === \"foo\" || value === \"bar\") {\n    return selection;\n  }\n  const index = selection.indexOf(value);\n  const newSelection = [...selection];\n  if(index >= 0) {\n    // value is already selected, remove it\n    newSelection.splice(index);\n    return newSelection;\n  }\n  // value is not selected, add it\n  return [value, ...newSelection];\n};\n```\n\nThe custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value `foo` or `bar`. Otherwise it acts just like the multiple selection mode.\n</docs>\n<tip>A button group may only contain `fd-button-group-button`s. If you use `FdButton` instead, things will not work correctly.\n\n**Important**\n\nMake sure to set `aria-label` on the button group.\n</tip>\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <fd-button-group\n      v-model=\"activeButtons\"\n      selectionMode=\"multiple\"\n      aria-label=\"Favorite Color\"\n    >\n      <fd-button-group-button value=\"a\">Red</fd-button-group-button>\n      <fd-button-group-button value=\"b\">Green</fd-button-group-button>\n      <fd-button-group-button value=\"c\">Blue</fd-button-group-button>\n    </fd-button-group>\n    <br /><br />\n    <fd-button-group\n      v-model=\"activeButtons\"\n      selectionMode=\"multiple\"\n      aria-label=\"Favorite Icon\"\n    >\n      <fd-button-group-button icon=\"survey\" value=\"a\" />\n      <fd-button-group-button icon=\"pool\" value=\"b\" />\n      <fd-button-group-button icon=\"pie-chart\" value=\"c\" />\n    </fd-button-group>\n    <br /><br />\n\n    Values of selected Buttons: {{ activeButtons }}\n  </div>\n</template>\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data() {\n    return {\n      activeButtons: []\n    };\n  }\n};\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./4-groups.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./4-groups.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__title = \"Button Groups\"\n}","import mod from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--14-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./4-groups.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--14-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./4-groups.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__docs = \"<p>Use an <code>fd-button-group</code> in order to group buttons. <code>fd-button-group-button</code> supports everything (ex. <code>icon</code>, <code>@click(…), …</code>) a regular <code>FdButton</code> does.

Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.</p>\\n<pre><code class=\\\"language-javascript\\\">const mySelectionMode = (selection, <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span>) =&gt; {\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> === <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"foo\\\"</span> || <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> === <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"bar\\\"</span>) {\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> selection;\\n  }\\n  const index = selection.indexOf(<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span>);\\n  const newSelection = [...selection];\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">if</span>(index &gt;= <span class=\\\"hljs-number\\\">0</span>) {\\n    // <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">is</span> already selected,<span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\"> remove</span> it\\n    newSelection.splice(index);\\n    <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> newSelection;\\n  }\\n  // <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-literal\\\">is</span><span class=\\\"hljs-built_in\\\"> not</span> selected, add it\\n  <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">return</span> [<span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">value</span>, ...newSelection];\\n};</code></pre>\\n<p>The custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value <code>foo</code> or <code>bar</code>.

It highlights three aspects:\n\n### Sortable Columns\n\nA header can be made sortable by simply flagging it as such using `sortable` and setting `sortBy` to any sortable property of the objects in your `items`-array. By doing so `FdTable` displays sort indicators in the individual column headers. The currently applied sorting can be adjusted by simply clicking on the column headers.\n\n### Custom Cell Content\nUp until now `fd-table-cell` was only used to display plain text. However, `fd-table-cell` is simply rendering whatever you put in it. This can be anything from emojis (we all like emojis, right? 😀 🥰 ) to images and even custom components.\n\n```xml\n<!-- item.rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ -->\n<fd-table-cell>{{ item.rating }}</fd-table-cell>\n\n<!-- display a full name -->\n<fd-table-cell>\n  {{item.firstName}} {{item.lastName}}\n</fd-table-cell>\n\n\n<!-- display a button -->\n<fd-table-cell>\n  <fd-button>Hello World</fd-button>\n</fd-table-cell>\n```\n\nThe two lines above show that in action.
