In this case, you do not need the CDN link as this method uses the SASS/SCSS source.</p>\\n<p>To install the Fundamental Styles SASS/SCSS source:</p>\\n<pre><code>$ npm <span class=\\\"hljs-keyword\\\">install</span> <span class=\\\"hljs-comment\\\">--save fundamental-styles</span></code></pre><p>The following assumes the usage of a module bundler such as <a href=\\\"https://webpack.js.org/\\\">webpack</a>. To compile Fundamental Styles SASS/SCSS to CSS, two additional packages are required for your bundling process - <a href=\\\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/sass-loader\\\">sass-loader</a> and <a href=\\\"https://github.com/sass/node-sass\\\">node-sass</a>.

This is a <a href=\\\"https://github.com/SAP/fundamental-styles#known-issues\\\">known issue</a>.</p>\\n<p>To rectify this, start by creating a new directory (&#39;scss&#39;) in your project&#39;s <code>src</code>. Within this directory, create a main SCSS file (&#39;main.scss&#39;) from which to manage your imports, configurations and customisations.</p>\\n<p>Add the following to the main SCSS file:</p>\\n<pre><code><span class=\\\"hljs-variable\\\">$fd-icons-path</span> : <span class=\\\"hljs-string\\\">\\\"../node_modules/fundamental-styles/scss/icons/\\\"</span>;

If `FdTable` encounters an item without an `id`-property, an `id` will be created. The `id` of an item is used to uniquely identify the corresponding item. Each item may contain any additional custom properties.\n\n### FdTable Atonomy\n\n#### The Table Header: `FdTableHeader`\nIt is the responsibility of `FdTable` to render it's header. The header renders column names, sort indicators and custom content. You configure the header of an `FdTable` by using it's `headers`-prop. The `headers`-prop accepts an array which may contain strings or header configuration objects. A plain string inside the `headers`-array will be used as a label for the column header. The complete definition of the `headers`-prop looks like this:\n\n```typescript\ntype Header = {\n  label: string;\n  sortable?: boolean;\n  sortBy?: string;\n  alignment?: TextAlignment; // 'center' or 'default'\n  renderHeader?: HeaderCellRenderFunction; // not yet implemented\n} | string;\n```\n\n#### The Table Row Template: `FdTableRow`\nRows are rendered by `FdTable` on your behalf. This is why you don't specify each row individually. Instead you describe how to render a row (`FdTableRow`) given some context (using Vue's __slot-scope__-mechanism). The object passed to the template has the following shape:\n\n```typescript\n// Object passed to the row template.\ninterface RowSlotProps<T=object> {\n  // Your custom item\n  item: T & { id: string; };\n\n  // True if the corresonding row is currently selected\n  selected: boolean;\n\n  // Call this if you want to change the selection\n  // Of the current row. Typically bound to an\n  // `@change`-event from `FdCheckbox`-instances.\n  changeSelection(selected: boolean, event: Event): void;\n}\n```\n</docs>\n\n<tip>\n`FdTable` is pretty fast. However it currently renders everything no matter whether an item is currently displayed or not. The `items`-array should be somewhere around `0` and `5.000`. Otherwise `FdTable` will crash your browser. We are working on removing that limitation. In the meantime you should work around that by using some kind of paging mechanism.\n</tip>\n\n<template>\n  <FdTable :headers=\"headers\" :items=\"items\">\n    <template slot=\"row\" slot-scope=\"{ item }\">\n      <FdTableRow>\n        <FdTableCell>{{ item.firstName }}</FdTableCell>\n        <FdTableCell>{{ item.lastName }}</FdTableCell>\n        <FdTableCell>{{ item.building }}</FdTableCell>\n      </FdTableRow>\n    </template>\n  </FdTable>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data: () => ({\n    headers: [\"First Name\", \"Last Name\", \"Building\"],\n    items: [\n      { rating: 1, firstName: \"Chris\", lastName: \"Kienle\", building: \"WFD02\" },\n      { rating: 2, firstName: \"Andi\", lastName: \"Kienle\", building: \"WFD03\" },\n      { rating: 3, firstName: \"Sven\", lastName: \"Bacia\", building: \"WFD02\" },\n      { rating: 4, firstName: \"Artur\", lastName: \"Raess\", building: \"WFD02\" }\n    ]\n  })\n};\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-default.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-default.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__title = \"Table\"\n}","import mod from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--15-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-default.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--15-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-default.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__docs = \"<p>Use <code>FdTable</code> in order to display data best visualized by rows and columns.</p>\\n<div class=\\\"tip\\\" style=\\\"border-left: 0.5rem solid #ffa94a;\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"tip-title\\\">IMPORTANT</div>\\n  <div class=\\\"tip-body\\\">\\n    <p>In a previous release you didn't have to put <code>FdTableRow</code> in a <code>template</code>.

Sorting</title>\n\n<docs>\nThe example below is a little bit more complex. It highlights three aspects:\n\n### Sortable Columns\n\nA header can be made sortable by simply flagging it as such using `sortable` and setting `sortBy` to any sortable property of the objects in your `items`-array. By doing so `FdTable` displays sort indicators in the individual column headers. The currently applied sorting can be adjusted by simply clicking on the column headers.\n\n### Custom Cell Content\nUp until now `FdTableCell` was only used to display plain text. However, `FdTableCell` is simply rendering whatever you put in it. This can be anything from emojis (we all like emojis, right? 😀 🥰 ) to images and even custom components.\n\n```html\n// …\n<FdTableCell>{{item.rating}}</FdTableCell>\n// …\n<FdTableCell>{{item.firstName}} {{item.lastName}}</FdTableCell>\n// …\n```\n\nThe two lines above show that in action. The first cell is simply rendering the rating which is just a string with emojis. The second line is combining the first name with the last name in order to render the full name. But as already said: You can put in whatever you want.\n\n### Modifying the displayed Items\n`FdTable` watches for any changes to it's items array. So you can simply add/remove and modify anything you want.\n</docs>\n\n<tip>\nIf you modify the `items`-array, make sure that the modification is done in a way compatible with [Vue's reactivity system](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html).\n</tip>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <FdTable :headers=\"headers\" :items=\"items\">\n      <template slot=\"row\" slot-scope=\"{ item }\">\n        <FdTableRow>\n          <FdTableCell>{{ item.rating }}</FdTableCell>\n          <FdTableCell>{{ item.firstName }}</FdTableCell>\n          <FdTableCell>{{ item.lastName }}</FdTableCell>\n          <FdTableCell>{{ item.firstName }} {{ item.lastName }}</FdTableCell>\n        </FdTableRow>\n      </template>\n    </FdTable>\n\n    <h2>Creating an Entry</h2>\n\n    <FdFormSet>\n      <FdFormItem label=\"First Name\">\n        <FdInput\n          v-model=\"newEntry.firstName\"\n          placeholder=\"Enter something nice\"\n        />\n      </FdFormItem>\n      <FdFormItem label=\"Last Name\">\n        <FdInput\n          v-model=\"newEntry.lastName\"\n          placeholder=\"Enter something nice\"\n        />\n      </FdFormItem>\n      <FdFormItem label=\"Rating\">\n        <FdCombobox v-model=\"newEntry.rating\">\n          <FdMenuItem value=\"️️️⭐️\">\n            ⭐️\n          </FdMenuItem>\n          <FdMenuItem value=\"⭐️⭐️\">\n            ⭐️⭐️\n          </FdMenuItem>\n          <FdMenuItem value=\"⭐️⭐️⭐️\">\n            ⭐️⭐️⭐️\n          </FdMenuItem>\n          <FdMenuItem value=\"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\">\n            ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n          </FdMenuItem>\n          <FdMenuItem value=\"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\">\n            ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\n          </FdMenuItem>\n        </FdCombobox>\n      </FdFormItem>\n    </FdFormSet>\n    <FdButton @click=\"addCurrentEntry\">Add Entry</FdButton>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    addCurrentEntry() {\n      const entry = {\n        ...this.newEntry\n      };\n      this.items = [...this.items, entry];\n      this.newEntry = {\n        firstName: null,\n        lastName: null,\n        rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n        id: String(this.items.length + 1)\n      };\n    }\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      headers: [\n        { label: \"Rating\", sortable: true, sortBy: \"rating\" },\n        { label: \"First Name\", sortable: true, sortBy: \"firstName\" },\n        { label: \"Last Name\", sortable: true, sortBy: \"lastName\" },\n        { label: \"Full Name\", sortable: true, sortBy: \"firstName\" }\n      ],\n      newEntry: {\n        firstName: null,\n        lastName: null,\n        rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n        id: \"5\"\n      },\n      items: [\n        {\n          id: \"1\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Chris\",\n          lastName: \"Kienle\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"2\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Andi\",\n          lastName: \"Kienle\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"3\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Sven\",\n          lastName: \"Bacia\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"4\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Artur\",\n          lastName: \"Raess\"\n        }\n      ]\n    };\n  }\n};\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./3-complex.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./3-complex.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__title = \"Example: Adding Entries & Sorting\"\n}","import mod from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--15-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./3-complex.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--15-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./3-complex.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__docs = \"<p>The example below is a little bit more complex.
