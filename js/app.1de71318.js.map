If `fd-table` encounters an item without an `id`-property, an `id` will be created. The `id` of an item is used to uniquely identify the corresponding item. Each item may contain any additional custom properties.\n\n### fd-table Atonomy\n\n#### The Table Header: `fd-tableHeader`\nIt is the responsibility of `fd-table` to render it's header. The header renders column names, sort indicators and custom content. You configure the header of an `fd-table` by using it's `headers`-prop. The `headers`-prop accepts an array which may contain strings or header configuration objects. A plain string inside the `headers`-array will be used as a label for the column header. The complete definition of the `headers`-prop looks like this:\n\n```typescript\ntype Header = {\n  label: string;\n  sortable?: boolean;\n  sortBy?: string;\n  alignment?: TextAlignment; // 'center' or 'default'\n  renderHeader?: HeaderCellRenderFunction; // not yet implemented\n} | string;\n```\n\n#### The Table Row Template: `fd-table-row`\nRows are rendered by `fd-table` on your behalf. This is why you don't specify each row individually. Instead you describe how to render a row (`fd-table-row`) given some context (using Vue's __slot-scope__-mechanism). The object passed to the template has the following shape:\n\n```typescript\n// Object passed to the row template.\ninterface RowSlotProps<T=object> {\n  // Your custom item\n  item: T & { id: string; };\n\n  // True if the corresonding row is currently selected\n  selected: boolean;\n\n  // Call this if you want to change the selection\n  setSelected(selected: boolean): void;\n\n  selectedIds: string[];\n  canSelect: boolean;\n  toggle(): void;\n}\n```\n</docs>\n\n<tip>\n`fd-table` is pretty fast. However it currently renders everything no matter whether an item is currently displayed or not. The `items`-array should be somewhere around `0` and `5.000`. Otherwise `fd-table` will crash your browser. We are working on removing that limitation. In the meantime you should work around that by using some kind of paging mechanism.\n</tip>\n\n<template>\n  <fd-table :headers=\"['firstName', 'lastName', 'building']\" :items=\"items\">\n    <template #row=\"{ item }\">\n      <fd-table-row>\n        <template #firstName>\n          <fd-table-cell>\n            {{ item.firstName }}\n          </fd-table-cell>\n        </template>\n        <template #lastName>\n          <fd-table-cell>\n            {{ item.lastName }}\n          </fd-table-cell>\n        </template>\n        <template #building>\n          <fd-table-cell>\n            {{ item.building }}\n          </fd-table-cell>\n        </template>\n      </fd-table-row>\n    </template>\n  </fd-table>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  data: () => ({\n    items: [\n      { firstName: \"Chris\", lastName: \"Kienle\", building: \"WFD02\" },\n      { firstName: \"Andi\", lastName: \"Kienle\", building: \"WFD03\" },\n      { firstName: \"Sven\", lastName: \"Bacia\", building: \"WFD02\" },\n      { firstName: \"Artur\", lastName: \"Raess\", building: \"WFD02\" }\n    ]\n  })\n};\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-table-default.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-table-default.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__title = \"Table\"\n}","import mod from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--14-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-table-default.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../../loaders/block-loader.js??ref--14-0!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./0-table-default.vue?vue&type=custom&index=0&blockType=title\"","export default function (Component) {\nComponent.options.__docs = \"<p>Use <code>fd-table</code> in order to display data best visualized by rows and columns.</p>\\n<p><d-tip></d-tip></p>\\n<div class=\\\"fdd-tip\\\">\\n  <div class=\\\"fdd-tip__title\\\">IMPORTANT</div>\\n  <div class=\\\"fdd-tip__body\\\">\\n    <p>In a previous release you didn't have to put <code>fd-table-row</code> in a <code>template</code>.

You can use `v-model` on `fd-button-group-button`. The `value` of a button group is always an array which contains the `value` of each pressed/selected `fd-button-group-button`. You associate a value with a button group button by using it's `value`-prop. There are also three selection modes (specified by using the `selectionMode`-prop on the group):\n\n1. `single`: A single button can be pressed/selected at a time.\n2. `multiple`: Multiple buttons can be pressed/selected at a time.\n3. **A custom selection mode function**\n\n**Custom Selection Mode**\n\nIf you have special needs you can specific a custom selection mode function. Simply pass a function to the `selectionMode`-prop. The function will be called with the current selection and the value of button that has just been clicked/tapped. Your custom selection mode function then has to return an array which represents the new selection.\n\n```javascript\nconst mySelectionMode = (selection, value) => {\n  if(value === \"foo\" || value === \"bar\") {\n    return selection;\n  }\n  const index = selection.indexOf(value);\n  const newSelection = [...selection];\n  if(index >= 0) {\n    // value is already selected, remove it\n    newSelection.splice(index);\n    return newSelection;\n  }\n  // value is not selected, add it\n  return [value, ...newSelection];\n};\n```\n\nThe custom selection mode above ignores any interactions with buttons that have the value `foo` or `bar`. Otherwise it acts just like the multiple selection mode.\n</docs>\n<tip>A button group may only contain `fd-button-group-button`s.

It highlights three aspects:\n\n### Sortable Columns\n\nA header can be made sortable by simply flagging it as such using `sortable` and setting `sortBy` to any sortable property of the objects in your `items`-array. By doing so `FdTable` displays sort indicators in the individual column headers. The currently applied sorting can be adjusted by simply clicking on the column headers.\n\n### Custom Cell Content\nUp until now `fd-table-cell` was only used to display plain text. However, `fd-table-cell` is simply rendering whatever you put in it. This can be anything from emojis (we all like emojis, right? 😀 🥰 ) to images and even custom components.\n\n```xml\n<!-- item.rating: ⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ -->\n<fd-table-cell>{{ item.rating }}</fd-table-cell>\n\n<!-- display a full name -->\n<fd-table-cell>\n  {{item.firstName}} {{item.lastName}}\n</fd-table-cell>\n\n\n<!-- display a button -->\n<fd-table-cell>\n  <fd-button>Hello World</fd-button>\n</fd-table-cell>\n```\n\nThe two lines above show that in action. The first cell is simply rendering the rating which is just a string with emojis. The second line is combining the first name with the last name in order to render the full name. But as already said: You can put in whatever you want.\n\n### Modifying the displayed Items\n`fd-table` watches for any changes to it's items array. So you can simply add/remove and modify anything you want.\n</docs>\n\n<tip>\nIf you modify the `items`-array, make sure that the modification is done in a way compatible with [Vue's reactivity system](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html).\n</tip>\n\n<template>\n  <div>\n    <fd-table :headers=\"headers\" :items=\"items\">\n      <template #row=\"{ item }\">\n        <fd-table-row>\n          <template #rating>\n            <fd-table-cell>\n              {{ item.rating }}\n            </fd-table-cell>\n          </template>\n          <template #firstName>\n            <fd-table-cell>\n              {{ item.firstName }}\n            </fd-table-cell>\n          </template>\n          <template #lastName>\n            <fd-table-cell>\n              {{ item.lastName }}\n            </fd-table-cell>\n          </template>\n          <template #fullName>\n            <fd-table-cell>{{ item.firstName }} {{ item.lastName }}</fd-table-cell>\n          </template>\n        </fd-table-row>\n      </template>\n    </fd-table>\n\n    <h2>Creating an Entry</h2>\n\n    <fd-field-set>\n      <fd-form-item label=\"First Name\">\n        <FdInput v-model=\"newEntry.firstName\" placeholder=\"Enter something nice\" />\n      </fd-form-item>\n      <fd-form-item label=\"Last Name\">\n        <FdInput v-model=\"newEntry.lastName\" placeholder=\"Enter something nice\" />\n      </fd-form-item>\n      <fd-form-item label=\"Rating\">\n        <fd-combobox v-model=\"newEntry.rating\">\n          <fd-menu-item value=\"️️️⭐️\">⭐️</fd-menu-item>\n          <fd-menu-item value=\"⭐️⭐️\">⭐️⭐️</fd-menu-item>\n          <fd-menu-item value=\"⭐️⭐️⭐️\">⭐️⭐️⭐️</fd-menu-item>\n          <fd-menu-item value=\"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</fd-menu-item>\n          <fd-menu-item value=\"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\">⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️</fd-menu-item>\n        </fd-combobox>\n      </fd-form-item>\n    </fd-field-set>\n    <fd-button @click=\"addCurrentEntry\" icon=\"add\">Add Entry</fd-button>\n  </div>\n</template>\n\n<script>\nexport default {\n  methods: {\n    addCurrentEntry() {\n      const entry = {\n        ...this.newEntry\n      };\n      this.items = [...this.items, entry];\n      this.newEntry = {\n        firstName: null,\n        lastName: null,\n        rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n        id: String(this.items.length + 1)\n      };\n    }\n  },\n  data() {\n    return {\n      headers: [\n        { id: \"rating\", label: \"Rating\", sortable: true, sortBy: \"rating\" },\n        {\n          id: \"firstName\",\n          label: \"First Name\",\n          sortable: true,\n          sortBy: \"firstName\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"lastName\",\n          label: \"Last Name\",\n          sortable: true,\n          sortBy: \"lastName\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"fullName\",\n          label: \"Full Name\",\n          sortable: true,\n          sortBy: \"firstName\"\n        }\n      ],\n      newEntry: {\n        firstName: null,\n        lastName: null,\n        rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n        id: \"5\"\n      },\n      items: [\n        {\n          id: \"1\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Chris\",\n          lastName: \"Kienle\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"2\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Andi\",\n          lastName: \"Kienle\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"3\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Sven\",\n          lastName: \"Bacia\"\n        },\n        {\n          id: \"4\",\n          rating: \"⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️\",\n          firstName: \"Artur\",\n          lastName: \"Raess\"\n        }\n      ]\n    };\n  }\n};\n</script>\n","import mod from \"-!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--12-0!../../../../node_modules/thread-loader/dist/cjs.js!../../../../node_modules/babel-loader/lib/index.js!../../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./3-table-complex.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\";
